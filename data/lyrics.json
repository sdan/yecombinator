I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then\nI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off \"Xxplosive\" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on \"This Can't Be Life.\"\n\nAnd that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, \"Oh you a real soulful dude.\"\n[JAY-Z: \"Oh you a real soulful dude, man\"]\nAnd he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said\n\n[JAY-Z: \"Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here\"]\n\n\"Tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, \"What you think of it?\"\n\n[JAY-Z: \"So what you think of this?\"]\n\nAnd I was like, \"Man that shit tight,\" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...\n\n[Donda West: \"Come on, let's just go\"]\n\n...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...\n\n[Donda West: \"Kanye, baby, we're here\"]\n\n...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City.\" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX\n\n[Hiphop: \"No I think Jay gon' like this one right here\"]\n\nAnd I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, \"Yo what's up I'm Kanye.\"\n\n[Dame: \"Yo, you that kid, Kanye?\"]\n\n\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats\"\n\n[Dame: \"Jay got classics, G.\"]\n\nYou know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, \"Man that was tight.\"\n\n[JAY-Z: \"That, that was cool. That was hot.\"]\n\nThat was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them \"Jesus Walks\" and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, \"Naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...\n\n[Jessica: \"Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.\"]\n\nI'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up\n\n[\"Y'all niggas is stupid\"]\n\nLet's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad\n\n[Joe: \"We gonna change the game, buddy.\"]\n\nDame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\"\n\n[Dame: \"You gotta make sure it's not wack.\"]\n\nThen one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'\n\"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\nI got 11 plaques on my walls right now\nYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\"\nLike the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like \"oh shit\"\n\n[Dame: \"Oh shit it's not even wack.\"]\n\n\"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\"\n\n[Dame: \"it's actually kinda hot.\"]\n\nLike they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like \"yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick\"\n\n[Dame: \"you don't wanna catch a brick\"]\n\n\"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.\" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer-rapper,\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\"\n\n[Mel: \"Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.\"]\n\nAnd, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?\"\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?143Embed",

        "text": "1 ContributorMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy Review (Revised) LyricsSince everyone was butthurt over my last review because I pulled a Kanye and gave you what you NEED and not what you WANT, so here is exactly what you want. A nice REVIEW that is not \"for the IQ\" and is indeed a REVIEW, and gives MBDTF a 10/10 like the mainstream says. So I swallowed my pride and downed my \"alt\" opinion and wrote this. (So dramatic). So here its is:\n\n\n\nIn 2010, Kanye West dropped an album that is widely regarded as a classic, because it is one of the best albums on the planet. With magnificent beats and innovative rapping by Kanye, and a slew of amazing guest features, this is the best way to apologize\n\nThis whole album serves as a sort of \"sorry but not sorry\" apology from Kanye after his stunt at the VMA's. He manages to apologize to the fans with this masterful album, but the lyrics tell you to kiss his ass\n\nLyrically, Kanye improves from his last album and production wise he did, too. He takes hours upon hours to make sure that this was the best album he ever released, and I agree. So lets begin:\n\n1. Dark Fantasy-10/10 / Kanye comes into this album with unapologetic lyrics, a great beat and wonderful vocals. This starts off the \"fuck everyone\" vibe that carries onto every other song. Kanye's mean-but-sarcastic vocals make the message clear: He doesn't care\n2. Gorgeous-10/10 / Kid Cudi's wonderful vocals aid this song's deep meaning: this is the apology part of the album. Kanye writes a verse that targets the nuances of the world that most likely caused his anger to come out at the VMA's. He pours himself into this song, I keep listening to it over and over again, I'm drawn in\n3. Power-10/10 / This fun and upbeat song tells a much different story than the last. Kanye tells us all to kiss his ass, he's not sorry. This change of tone makes the fun sound of this song work. I love the beat, the Schizoid man juxtaposition, and Kanye's great flow and lyricism. The technicality of his verses are spectacular\n4. All Of The Lights Interlude-10/10 / This amazing instrumental raises the experience of the next track so much, it is masterfully crafted and amazing, it is wonderfully made, and I love it\n5. All Of The Lights-10/10 / This inspirational song makes you want to get up and do something! Kanye picked the perfect artists to be on the track to make the biggest and best sound. You can just hear the layers and it helps the experience of the tape. It's a magical song\n6. Monster-10/10 / Nicki killed her verse, it's the best verse I have ever heard from Nicki in her career! Kanye puts out a verse that is so unapologetically out there that you have to love it. The beat is perfect, and the features all kill their verses. Kanye has done it again!\n7. So Appalled-10/10 / Such a majestic work of art! The features, beat and concept are outstanding. Kanye makes this work of art come to life, a living, breathing idea. He shows his message well\n8. Devil In a New Dress-10/10 / Rick Ross came out of nowhere with his amazing verse that killed the whole thing. I love the entire idea of this song, Kanye brings the whole idea to life\n9. Runaway-10/10 / Pusha T and Kanye both bring their A-game here, with sad and true stories that are really deep, and show resolve. This song makes you want to cry, it touches your heart\n10. Hell Of a Life-10/10 / Kanye's wordplay and lyricism are the best of his career here, he spits absolute fire. It's magnificent how well this song goes. I love the Iron Man infused hook, it makes this song irresistible\n11. Blame Game-10/10 / This insanely emotional song has Kanye very in touch with himself.

shit\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nMy wife said I can't say no to nobody\nAnd at this rate, we gon' both die broke\nGot friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt\nAnd like my wife said, I still didn't say no\nPeople tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter\nMy friends' best advice was to stay low\nI guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills\nEspecially when you got family members on payroll\nThe media said it was outlandish spendin'\nThe media said he's way out of control\nI just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'\nI'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control\nI know I'm the most influential\nThat TIME cover was just confirmation\nThis generation's closest thing to Einstein\nSo don't worry about me, I'm fine\nI can see a thousand years from now in real life\nSkate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like\nTroll conventional thought, don't need to question\nI know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive\nThank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission\nDid it with no permission, on our own conditions\nMost blacks with money have been beaten to submission\nYeezy with the big house, did it way different\nNever listen to Hollywood producers\nDon't stare at money too long, it's Medusa\nThe ultimate Gemini has survived\nI wasn't supposed to make it past 25\nYou might also like[Chorus: Sampha]\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church

more to come\nA million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums\nI believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro\nIf the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho\nBrother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation\nHe sat back and smiled\nBlack on black lies is worse than black on black crime\nThe Jews share their truth on how to make a dime\nMost black men couldn't balance a checkbook\nBut buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, \"How my neck look?\"\nWell, it all looks great\nFour hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains\nThe light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard\nReal family stick together and see through the mirage\nThe smokescreens, perceptions of false reality\nWho the real owner if your boss gets a salary?\nI am one with the people\nI am one with the people (Real!)\nI've been woken from enlightened man's dream\nCheckin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem\nLet me not say too much or do too much\n'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch\nI'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen\nSo the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'\nGod, I have humbled myself before the court\nDrop my ego when confidence was my last resort\nI know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams\nOne set of footsteps, You was carryin' me\nWhen I turned on the news and they was buryin' me\nOne set of footsteps, You was carryin' me\nWhen I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me\nTold Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see\nI would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov\nI heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove\nBut it's better that I stayed at home with my folks\n'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke\nOnly thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go\nWe all go\nNot just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo\nShe got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo\nModern-day MJ, with a off-the-wall flow\n[Bridge: Sampha]\nNightlife, walk all over me\nWalk all over me\nI'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent that you'll bring\nFly, fly, fly overseas\nFly overseas\nOh, anywhere, everything but in between\nOh, yeah\n\n[Chorus:

feel so alone\nLike I don't know anyone except the night sky above\n[Chorus: Sampha]\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nAnd you wonder where is God in your nightlife\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\n(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)\nWonderin' whether God's

Does He really live in your heart?\nIs my God your Lord and savior? Do your gifts say from the maker?\n\nChorus\nYour fears are a feast for wolves\nYour fears are a feast for wolves\n\nVerse 2\n\nNow everything changed. You done ran from the vision and got the fangs\nThought you were fighting for freedom but got the chains\nYou done let them pull your body from your frame\nWhat's the definition, of freedom without creator, living without a purpose, winning without a hater?\n\nBlinded by your ambition you cut off the holy savior, you're playing with suicide, self destruction is your nature screaming\n\"I don't need a savior when I know I'm the best.\" Intoxicated by the mirror, I am Kanye West\nYou might also likeI don't want to listen even of he is my creator\nI don't want to change nothing on my worst behavior\n\nNow my vices rocking chains as they follow me out\nBlood stained gold fangs with my flesh in they mouth\nWounded and weighed down by the doubts in my head\nAnd so the wolves kill another as they feast on the dead\n\nChorus\nYour fears are a feast for wolves\nYour fears are a feast for wolvesEmbed",

about to catch a body\nCell phone goin' Nazi\nI'm about to catch a body!\n[Verse 5: NewAgeWonder]\nEverything I touch may disintegrate into dust (uh huh)\nEverything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on)\nEverything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings\nOut for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was\nI don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back\nI ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that\nI don't resonate with the concept of love and hate\nCause your perspective is less effective and rather fake\nThe universe and the heavens work in my DNA\nKendrick said \"Fuck Mother Earth,\" that's PSA\nThe land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit\nWalking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness\nUncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again\nThe underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in\nThe big money, the fast cars, my life produced\nThe blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube\nSo what you look up to?\nFame and fortune, bitches, Porsches\nSources with designer thing\nBrand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me\nLaw enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed\nFuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed\nWho knew Royce's with choices of color my desire need\nCrab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee\nFlesh and poison the point is the reason\nYou won't die in peace\nOpen door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally\nI destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me\nTape recording my voices and tweak it\nLet's play hide and seek\nWar distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least\nI'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast\nI don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD\nHair like ODB, I'm off a higher need\nKhaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration\nBut when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix\n[Verse 6: ThaHipHopHead]\nI got dough stashed in Detroit\nYou know I got cash on this joint\nComin' to bash all of them boys\nDropping my name, actin' a ploy\nMy destiny, is incredibly\nPotent, and I know what's best for me\nKeep competition leanin' like promethazine\nKeep my enemies chest breathing ceasing with ease\nYou know that I got this\nI got no jewels in the pockets\nBut I spit jewels for your noggin\nSo my albums you'll keep coppin'\nAnd y'all know I won't ever stop, bitch\nI'm coming with bars that won't ever stop droppin'\nThe competition try to strike back but their bars are sloppy\nI drop a sixteen, and I'll have all of your heads

white, hot thot pop for the candy\nYou finesse with the two step, I pride myself on the tango\nGitgitgit for my tempo, prozac, xans and that fanny\nGot a blonde bish, named Tammy, pussy good cum prematurely\nSecure the bag, securely, secure the bag alert!\nTeacher named Cassie, she got me coming in early\nI got the ruler, da ruger and I might go make me some earl tea\n\n[once this is done I get the last verse: StillBrazyIsAOTYDealWithIt]\nI got charts in America\nWe really need Erykah\nTo save us from this pile\nOf mediocrity into a file\n\"Me Too\": hit song\nAnd it makes me want to hit a gong\nAs hard as I can\nBecause I'm almost a man\nI'm sure we've all had plenty\nOf \"Controlla\" and #20\nWhich is also by Drake\n\"Too Good\", it sounds fake\n\"Needed Me\" is diving\nBut Twenty One Pilots are thriving\nWith their song called \"Ride\"\nAt least their last song died\n\"Cold Water\" hit #2\nAnd Jacob Sartorius debuted\n\"Cheap Thrills\" is boring\n\"One Dance\" has me snoring\n\"Send My Love\"'s really bland\nFlorida Georgia Line are bad band\nThey made a song called \"H.O.L.Y.\"\nIt sticks out very boldly\nThey aren't even religious\nSpit so many verses sometimes my jaw twitches\nI don't want to hear any more\nOf \"This Is What You Came For\"\nI feel like stealing\nBecause of \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\"\nI'm always wearing a frown\nAll thanks to \"Don't Let Me Down\"\nI \"Don't Mind\" \"For Free\"\nBut it's worse than Kendrick's, you see\n\"Heathens\" is okay\nBut the pitch shifted vocal annoys me every day\n\"Work from Home\" needs to go\nJust like \"Just like Fire\", no?\nFinally, \"Treat You Better\"\nShawn Mendes is not a trendsetter\nJust because he's from Vine\nDoesn't mean he gets to whine\n\n... \"Panda\", panda, panda, panda, panda...5Embed",

        "text": "173 ContributorsTop 100 Rap Songs of 2014 Lyrics100. Ghostface Killah ft. AZ, Kool G Rap &  Tre Williams \"The Battlefield\"\"The Battlefield\" is an amazing portrayal of hip-hop's recent evolution. The genre is starting to age, and so are its key musicians. Mafioso rap veterans Ghostface, AZ and Kool G take their adulthood experiences and apply them to the metaphorical battlefield. Never forget - there's a war going on outside.99. Apollo Brown & Rass Kass ft. Pharoahe Monch & Rakaa Iriscience \"H20\"98. Travi$ Scott ft. Big Sean \"Don't Play\"97. Mac Miller ft. Vince Staples \"Rain\"96. Isaiah Rashad ft. SZA \"West Savannah\"95. Vic Mensa\t\"Feel That\"Following his breakout mixtape Innanetape and four appearances on last year\u2019s top 100 song list, Vic Mensa is back with his Smoko Ono produced banger \"Feel That\". The song breaks away from Vic\u2019s reputation as a \u201clyrical\u201d rapper, substituting lyrical complexity for a strong flow and crazy energy. Vic\u2019s about to take over the game and we feel that!94. Mick Jenkins\tft Joey Bada$$ \"Jerome\"93. Tinashe ft Schoolboy Q \"2 On\"92. Jay Electronica ft. LaTonya Givens \"Better In Tune With The Infinite\"91. Big K.R.I.T. \"King Of The South\"90. PRyhme \"Courtesy\" In classic Premo style, the production is lead by organs and 90's scratched vocal samples. Royce blesses us with two thrilling verses - snarky shots at his competition, sprinkled pop culture references, and packed wordplay. Rapping well is the only way he knows how, and it proves true on this record.89. Childish Gambino \"Sober\"88. NehruvianDOOM \"OM\"87. Drake\t\"How About Now\"86. Statik Selektah ft Action Bronson, Royce da 5'9 & Black Thought \"The Imperial\"85. O.T Genasis\t\"CoCo\"BAKIN' SODA, I GOT BAKIN' SODA!O.T took the internet by storm with this cocaine ballad. His hilariously serious tone combined with references to Nemo and Nino Brown made us all fall in love with the coco, even Nicki Minaj. The biggest fans of this song are O.T's peers - y'all saw what happened to Busta Rhymes, right?84. Vince Staples ft James Fauntleroy \"Nate\"83. Lupe Fiasco ft Ty Dolla $ign \"Deliver\"82. Theophilus London ft Kanye West \"Can't Stop\"81. Future ft. Andre 3000 \"Benz Friends (Whatchutola)\"80. Jay Electronica ft. Jay Z \"We Made It Freestyle\" Jay Electricity and Hova joined forces at the top of the  year to murder Drake & Soulja Boy\u2019s 2013 New Year anthem \u201cWe Made It\u201d. The chemistry is undeniable as the two flow effortlessly over the blaring horns. While both dropped serious knowledge on The Five Percent Nation of Islam, every line packs a punch. Exhibit A? Jigga hitting Drizzy square in the jaw with this right hook: \u201cSorry Mrs. Drizzy for so much art talk/Silly me rappin' 'bout shit that I really bought\u201d79. Beyonce ft. Nicki Minaj \"***Flawless Remix\"78. ScHoolboy Q \"Prescription/Oxymoron\"77. Travis Scott ft Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug \"Mamacita\"76. YG ft. Jay Rock & ScHoolboy Q \"I Just Wanna Party\"75. Dej Loaf\t\"Try Me\"From the moment the muted twinkles of DDS\u2019 \u201cTry Me\u201d beat creeps in, Dej commands the year\u2019s most threatening anthem without ever raising her voice past a Cam\u2019ronian monotone. It runs like a checklist of guaranteed hip-hop success. Hook? Infectious. Flow? Unique, yet copyable by the lay listener. Lyrics? Quotable. But what exalts this song to its heights is Dej Loaf\u2019s undeniable, next-level swagger, one that makes her one rapper you really might not want to try.74. Young Thug ft. A$AP Ferg & Freddie Gibbs \"Old English\"73. Lil Wayne ft. The LOX \"Gotti\"72. Mick Jenkins \"The Waters\"71. Game \"Bigger Than Me\"70. Childish Gambino \"Candler Road\"Bino pays homage to a road in his hometown in Decatur, Atlanta, a fitting name for an instrumental that contains an interpolation of his because the internet song \u201cTelegraph Ave.\u201d The improvised scat hook puts a cherry on top of the seemingly effortless track that stands out as his best rap song of the year.69. Wu-Tang Clan \"Ruckus In B Minor\"68. Kendrick Lamar \"Untitled\"67. OG Maco \"U Guessed It\"66. Drake \"Draft Day\"65. Donnie Trumpet ft. Chance The Rapper & Jamila Woods\t\"Sunday Candy\"The Social Experiment, a.k.a the Chicago \u201csymphony\u201d, switches things up to make a truly heartwarming track. Whether it\u2019s the soul-filled vocals from Jamila Woods & Co, or Chance the Rapper\u2019s two verses, nostalgia oozes out of every corner of this joint. With live instrumentation and composition by SoX, this release sets expectations high for their album SURF.64. ScHoolboy Q \"Hoover Street\"63. Common ft. Vince Staples \"Kingdom\"62. Jay Rock \"Parental Advisory\"61. Freddie Gibbs \"Shitsville\"60. Action Bronson \"Easy Rider\"The psych-rock sampling accompanies Bronsolino's timeless flow like a hot dog at the ball game. Gems like \u201cI had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans. Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin\u201d are classic Bam Bam. \"Easy Rider\" is Mr. Wonderful's acid trip on steroids.59. Eminem\t\"Shady XV\"58. Nicki Minaj \"Anaconda\"57. J.Cole \"January 28th\"56. Run The Jewels ft. boots \"Early\"55. Mac Miller \"Diablo\"Mac hit us with \u201cDiablo\u201d  on his Soundcloud account out of nowhere in February. The chilling piano line and Mac's delivery perfectly complement lyrics like \u201cContemplating suicide like it\u2019s a DVD / Lost inside my mind, it\u2019s a prison homie leave me be\u201d. The druggy philosopher we all fell in love with is back, and trippier than ever. 54. Freddie Gibbs \"Harold's\"53. Slaughterhouse \"Y'all Ready Know\"52. Logic \"Nikki\"51. Yelawolf \"Till It's Gone\"50. Pharoahe Monch ft. Black Thought \"Rapid Eye Movement\"From the moment the first bar is spat, you know Pharoahe and Tariq aren't strangers to the rap game. \"My think tank's like a piranha tank think, multiple bites figure / Mega, reality, tera, giga\" starts us off with a bang. \"Rapid Eye Movement\" sounds like it belongs in a James Bond movie49. PartyNextDoor ft. Drake \"Recognize\"48. Vic Mensa \"Down On My Luck\"47. PRyhme\t\"PRyhme\"46. Vince Staples \"Blue Suede\"45. Rae Sremmurd\t\"No Flex Zone\"Serving as Rae Sremmurd's debut single, this anthem quickly blew up the charts, clubs and streets to make the oddly named duo the biggest thing in hip hop. In fact, this track was so big that the remix featured two of the hottest rappers in recent times: Nicki Minaj and Pusha T44. Nicki Minaj ft. Chris Brown, Drake & Lil Wayne \"Only\" 43. Joey Bada$$\t\"Big Dusty\"42. Run The Jewels \"Blockbuster Night Pt. 1\"41. Big K.R.I.T.\t\"Cadillactica\"40. Pusha T \"Lunch Money\"What started as an accidental release turned out to be one of the best joints of the year. The G.O.D laid down the Contra style soundtrack, while King Push\u2019s flow was flawless. The drug dealer dichotomy did it again with lines like \u201cWhat's the price of success? Lost my bitch, bought a chef\u201d. This initial offering has us fiending for King Push, and unlike 2013\u2019s MNIMN, he won\u2019t need a pitch either - the shit sells itself.39. YG ft. Drake \"Who Do You Love\"38. Freddie Gibbs \"Deeper\"37. Mac Miller ft. Da$h & Earl Sweatshirt \"New Faces V2\"36. Rae Sremmurd \"No Type\"35. Isaiah Rashad \"Heavenly Father\"Here Isaiah Rashad delivers dark content over a soulful instrumental, creating a nice contrast between the two. A combination of Rashad's smooth, low-tempo flow, and a melodic hook from SZA, makes this for a heavenly performance. One of the best cuts from Cilvia Demo.34. Wiz Khalifa \"We Dem Boyz\"33. J.Cole \"No Role Modelz\"32. Future ft. Casino, Pharrell Williams & Pusha T \"Move That Dope\"31. Logic \"Soul Food\"30. Eminem ft. Big Sean, Danny Brown, Dej Loaf, Royce Da 5'9 & Trick Trick \"Detroit Vs Everybody\" Detroit up-and-comers Big Sean and Danny Brown come hard enough to successfully bridge the gap between Royce and Em\u2019s bookend verses. Between another show-stealing verse from Royce, a solid hook from Dej Loaf, and an outro from the director of the \u201cNo Fly Zone\u201d Trick Trick, this track should keep rival MCs wary of Detroit static for time to come.29. Jay Rock ft. Chantal Kreviazuk & Kendrick Lamar \"Pay For It\"28. Nas \"The Season\"27. Bad Meets Evil \"Vegas\"26. Logic \"Gang Related\"25. Freddie Gibbs ft. Danny Brown \"High\"Gangster Gibbs brings Danny on a marijuana-filled trip, backed with smooth and bass-banging production courtesy of Madlib. Getting high is what they do best, and it's no surprise hearing how well both of them sound on this joint. As expected, Danny's excited and high-registered verse flows perfectly with the beat as Freddie refuses to extinguish the fire.24. T.I ft. Young Thug \"About The Money\"23. Drake \"6 God\"22. Eminem ft. Sia \"Guts Over Fear\"21. Run The Jewels ft. Zack de la Rocha  \"Close Your Eyes (And Count To Fuck)\"20. Mick Jenkins \"Jazz\" Mick rides the beat using his notorious voice conviction skills, and as the beat mellows, his voice mellows; as the beat gets more chaotic, his voice rises. The lyrics, flow, and overall vibe of the song hits your soul and makes a new home. Mick wants us to ignore the lies and corruption in the world - and we already know that this black man ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 all that Jazz.19. Young Jeezy ft. Jay Z \"Seen It All\"Two of hip hop's most renowned hustlers join forces yet again and the result is nothing short of astonishing. The track is a clear highlight on Jeezy's album and one of Jay's finest verses in recent memory. They are both in top form as they vividly depict the experiences of their past drug dealings. You can clearly tell there's a genuine chemistry between the two. Even if you say this song blows - that's still a compliment. It was so real Jay was brought to tears while writing his verse.18. Rick Ross ft. Big Sean & Kanye West \"Sanctified\"Ross gruntFeaturing Big Sean and Kanye West in addition to production by DJ Mustard and West, \"Sanctified\" was easily the most anticipated track from Rozay's 6th album, Mastermind. While Kanye's verse was a PSA to the critics who continually attempt to tarnish his reputation, Ross rapped about grilled cheese and his Rolls Royce Wraith.\n\nNot only did \"Sanctified\" appear #1 on our Top 10 Beats of 2014 list, but it served as the background music for the greatest viral video of all time17. ILOVEMAKONNEN ft. Drake \"Tuesday (Remix)\"I Love Makonnen began 2014 as a relatively unknown artist struggling to gain relevance as a musician, and trying to break free from his manslaughter charges. Then one day...Drizzy decided to drop a verse onto \u201cTuesday\u201d and nothing was the same. Makonnen sings about his drug dealing past, and his busy schedule forcing him to bend the rules of when clubs can go up. Thanks to this single, clubs will never be the same on a Tuesday.16. J.Cole \t\"Wet Dreamz\"Over a classic sample, Cole gives us his vintage story telling as he reminisces about his first time with a girl. He holds a cool attitude as tells the girl he's a pro - even though he's never had sex before. As thing escalate further, he watches porn videos for pointers and practices putting on a condom before the plot takes a twist right at the end. What's scary is how well this song relates. We guarantee almost every male listener felt some type of way. 15. Lil Wayne ft. Drake \"Believe Me\" The release of \"Believe Me\"  raised Tha Carter V's hype up few notches thanks to the perfect combination of YMCMB's finest. Drake lays down the hook and two stylistically different verses; one that bounces perfectly with the Boi-1da-produced beat, and another with a gritty flow. Wayne matches Drake verse-for-verse and ends the track in memorable fashion\n\nOne of the more underrated aspects of \"Believe Me\"  is its versatility. You can bump it while you\u2019re browsing Genius, driving to work or school, or grinding through a workout. It appeals to all ears, just as we hope the entire album will.14. ScHoolboy Q \"Break tHe Bank\"Complete with a chilling piano line and a Mario Kart 64 sample from The Alchemist, the instrumental is perfect for a modern gangster rapper like ScHoolboy Q. Throughout the track he viciously reminds the listener that it's his time and that he ain't no one to fuck with. With Oxymoron debuting at number one on the billboard charts, and having sold over 320,000 copies, it is safe to say that Q is Breaking the bank. 13. A$AP Rocky ft. Juicy J \"Multiply\"After some uncharacteristic features, A$AP returned with one of the hardest hitting songs of the year in \"Multiply.\" The Flacko flow is on full display from the start; his signature internal rhyming bounces up and down on the beat with such rhythm that it wouldn\u2019t matter if he used to sell crack or lemonade in his living room\n\nDon\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be seeing an A$AP Lemonade Stand anytime soon as Rocky sticks to his typical rapper and fashion references. Throw in some Juicy J trash talk for good measure and A$AP\u2019s only single since Long.Live.A$AP is one of the year\u2019s best. Swag swag.12. Flying Lotus ft. Kendrick Lamar \"Never Catch Me\"Like a psychedelic rat race, \u201cNever Catch Me\u201d  has Kendrick Lamar running circles around this Flying Lotus masterpiece. The fusion of hip hop, jazz, & electronic styles has Kendrick spazzing like a rabid dog. The L.A natives take you on an outer body experience to stare death right in the face. Every few bars the instrumental changes as the race continues, like Kendrick\u2019s searching for something, getting faster, and faster, and as you reach your destination - \u201cbitch, you\u2019re dead!\u201d11. Joey Bada$$ \"Christ Conscious (Toroidal Flow)\"With an aggressive flow, Joey delivers a barrage of punchlines, wordplay, and utter energy that dazzles any listener. The beauty of these lyrical acrobats continues to prolong Joey\u2019s ability and shows he ain\u2019t no slacker when it comes down to the lyrics. Dragon Balls like his name was Vegeata, BADA$$  swears that no matter what, he won\u2019t stop until he reaches the level of Christ Conscious.10. Run The Jewels \"Oh My Darling Don't Cry\" Anchored by an El-P instrumental that can only be described as manic, the dynamic duo laces the beat with rhymes that are crude, insightful, and simultaneously both. What separates it from other RTJ tracks is the erosion in differences between the styles and personalities of the lead rappers. On RTJ1, Mike and El were characterized as aggressive and philosophical, respectively. But here El has no problem telling you to \u201crun backwards through a field of dicks\u201d as Mike peruses Egyptian scriptures. The chemistry is palpable, the flows are indescribable, and the result is one of the highlights of 2014.9. Rich Gang ft. Birdman, Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug \"Lifestyle\" EUUGHBLAHBEAHELGWLINAHDEWFQLFKQWFN LLLLLLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEEEEEESTYLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEFor a song that made many detractors reconsider Rich Homie Quan\u2019s \u201cone-hit wonder status\u201d and mainstream listeners delve into the Young Thug archives, the unintelligible nature of the lyrics for most listeners was its greatest asset: whatever personal details you added over the beat, you felt like your efforts were putting you on the fast-track to a Dionysian lifestyle of your own.8. ScHoolboy Q ft. BJ The Chicago Kid \"Studio\"ScHoolboy Q put his heart on his sleeve in this banger for the ladies, elaborating on the reality that life as a major musician can be hectic. From touring around the world to TV appearances to, in this case, late nights in the studio, it can be hard to balance a relationship with a busy work schedule.7. J.Cole \"Fire Squad\"If shock factor was what Cole was after with \"Fire Squad\" then he certainly achieved it. After boasting of his greatness in the first two verses, he took an interesting approach: highlighting white appropriation in the music of black culture. Not only did he just observe the sound-jacking, he name dropped some of the most well-known artists to ever do it.6. Bobby Shmurda \"Hot Nigga\"The relationship between artist and subject matter, in the hip-hop and r&b genres especially, is a dangerously liminal one. When Rick Ross gets chastised for portraying a criminal mastermind following his career in law enforcement, are we supposed to then turn around and congratulate Bobby Shmurda and his crew for their string of summer smashes for existing in a realm of authenticity? It wasn\u2019t the lyrics, nor the beat (on its second go-around, no less!) that made Bobby so hot. So when the chant-worthy one-liners become appear as more than fiction, should we cheer? Should we scold? Or should we Shmoney Dance the troubles away?!5. Logic \"Under Pressure\"The title track of the album is reminiscent of Logic\u2019s classic brag pieces, entailing his recent rise in popularity and success. Where the initial four-minute release dropped off is the track\u2019s elegant yet radical style shift - it transitions from his recent material success to a deeply introspective track reflecting on both his past and current state of affairs with family. This track serves as the crown jewel of the album - a diamond created from being under pressure.4. Big Sean ft. E-40 \"I Don't Fuck With You\"Sean Don and Bay Area godfather E-40 went big this year with the anthem for those without fucks to give. This track dropped along with \u201cParadise\u201d, \u201c4th Quarter\u201d, and \u201cJit/Juke\" through his website following the announcement of his signing to Roc Nation. The song samples \u201cSay You Love Me\u201d, as part of the exemplary accompaniment of Coach Kanye and DJ Mustard on the beat. His blatantly vulgar lyrics clearly express his lack of interest in those he is not \"down with\" and is reminiscent of \u201cI Don\u2019t Give A Fuck\u201d from Bo$$. While it has been confirmed that the record is not meant to be a shot to anyone in particular (including Naya Rivera with whom he recently split,) the message is still\u2026.Who ever I don't fuck with, I still don't fuck with you.3. Big K.R.I.T.\t\"Mt. Olympus\"Post KRIT's 2013 release, King Remembered In Time, more verbal lightning from Krizzle became high in demand, and he delivered. \"Mt. Olympus\" sees K.R.I.T. punish all the heathens of the rap game, showing them there really is a god. The fans wonder, \"Is he rap, is he snap?\". \"Is he bass, is he drank?\" Neither - he is a King Remembered in Time.2. Drake \"0-100/The Catch Up\"If there's one thing we've learned, it's that every song really does sound like Drake featuring Drake. \"Started from the bottom, now we here\" may have been 2013's catchphrase, but \"0 to 100 nigga, real quick\" took 2014 over almost as quickly as fans grabbed the free Soundcloud download of this track after its June release\n\nThe two-part track is a variety pack, filled with braggadocio, meme-worthy lines, and introspective thoughts. What makes \"0 to 100/The Catch Up\" so notable is the instantaneous shift from straight fire bars to a calmer profession of the same sentiment: Drake is perched at the top of the rap game and he's only getting better. That's a scary thought. We've already begun to see Drake back up these claims in his latest releases, and it's safe to say the anticipation for his next full-length project is nearly off the charts.1. Kendrick Lamar \"i\"Backed by funky production reminiscent of the wonder years of soul music, Kendrick broadcasts a message of self love.  The best messages are those easily understood, and Kendrick makes no mistakes with a simple \"I love myself\"\n\nSimilar to our number one song last year, Kanye West's \"New Slaves\", every facet of the song\u2019s concept was handled in one spectacularly orchestrated move. Whether it be the record, the music video, or the buzz - each element illustrates the message crystal clear. An anthem isn't created overnight, this song has been in Kendrick all his life. They can lock ya body, they can\u2019t trap ya mind.\n163Embed",

        "text": "43 Contributors50 Best Rap Songs of 2015 Lyrics2015's highlight reel stretches far and wide. Drake kicked the year off with \"Know Yourself,\" debutant Vince Staples held the \"Summertime\" down and Pusha T closed the year feeling \"Untouchable.\" Here are the 50 best rap songs of 2015, as voted on by Genius.com visitors. \u2014 Michael Heal\n50. Tyler, the Creator feat. Lil Wayne & Kanye West - \"Smuckers\"Dreams do come true, at least for Tyler, the Creator. While the outspoken rapper had a terrible year in the media, nothing could dampen seeing idols Lil Wayne and Kanye West jump on his track. With the best opening couplet of 2015: \u201cRicher than white people with black kids / Scarier than black people with ideas\u201d Yeezy hopped on his Late Registration flow in arguably his best feature of 2015. Similarly, Weezy takes things back to  Tha Carter II days with two show stopping verses. Although Tyler narrowly escaped being \u201crenegaded,\u201d credit is due for cultivating one of the top tracks of the year. \u2014 Ben Carter\n49. YG - \"Twist My Fingaz\"48. Bryson Tiller - \"Sorry Not Sorry\"47. Rae Sremmurd - \"Come Get Her\"46. Young Thug - \"Best Friend\"45. Future - \"Fuck Up Some Commas\"44. King Los feat. Marsha Ambrosius- \"War\"43. Earl Sweatshirt - \"Faucet\"42. Ty Dolla $ign feat. Future & Rae Sremmurd - \"Blas\u00e9\"41. Vic Mensa feat. Kanye West - \"U Mad\"40. Isaiah Rashad - \"Nelly\"Isaiah keeps to the winning formula with producers Chris Calor and The Antydote for his first single since 2014\u2019s Cilvia Demo. The fluid, soothing song sees Rashad provide the personal lyrics he\u2019s known for. The song title refers to the success of rapper Nelly: \u201cCause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song\u201d \u2014 Rashad embraces individuality and encourages fans to rock out no matter what anyone thinks.. \u2014 YahwehSolomon\n39. Mick Jenkins - \"P's & Q's\"38. Freddie Gibbs - \"Careless\"37. Future feat. Drake - \"Where Ya At\"36. Kanye West feat. Paul McCartney - \"Only One\"35. Travis Scott feat. Kacy Hill - \"90210\"34. Meek Mill feat. Tory Lanez - \"Lord Knows\"33. Jay Rock - \"Gumbo\"32. Action Bronson feat. Chance The Rapper - \"Baby Blue\"31. The Game feat. Drake - \"100\"30. Pusha T - \"Untouchable\"If anyone knows the key to success, it\u2019s Pusha T. Aided by a Biggie sample, King Push flexes his lyrical prowess over a dark Timbaland instrumental. From Donald Trump references, to Birdman disses and pop-culture mentions, Pusha  vacuum packs the wordplay. When it comes to D-Boy rap, Pusha T really is \"Untouchable\".\n\u2014 Michael Heal\n29. Lupe Fiasco feat. Ayesha Jaco - \"Prisoner 1 & 2\"28. A$AP Rocky - \"L$D\"27. Mac Miller - \"100 Grandkids\"26. Logic feat. Big Lenbo - \"Young Jesus\"25. Post Malone - \"White Iverson\"24. Vince Staples - \"Se\u00f1orita\"23. Drake & Future - \"Jumpman\"22. Big Sean feat. Drake & Kanye West - \"Blessings\"21. Dr. Dre feat. Marsha Ambrosius, King Mez & Kendrick Lamar - \"Darkside/Gone\"20. Young Thug - \"Check\"God forbid somebody actually started paying Young Thug in checks instead of cash\u2014he makes the stack phone look way too cool. And while no checks show up in the video for \u201cCheck,\u201d the rest of the aesthetic stays true to his form: junk food, left-field fashion choices (a Hooters tank-top, anyone?), and a blatant disregard for money. Thug is one of the few artists out there whose videos perfectly capture the song\u2019s intentions, and it succeeds in complementing the turn-up anthem. Unlike other stand-out tracks of his from 2015, \u201cCheck\u201d doesn\u2019t see too many vocal twists or absurd lyrics, and that in itself makes for a jarring experience contrary to what\u2019s expected. You never know what you\u2019re going to get out of Young Thug, but you know disappointment isn\u2019t in the cards. \u2014 Brian Duricy\n19. Chance The Rapper feat. Saba - \"Angels\"18. A$AP Rocky feat. Mark Ronson, Rod Stewart & Miguel - \"Everyday\"17. Joey Bada$$ - \"Paper Trail$\"16. Skepta - \"Shutdown\"15. Vince Staples - \"Norf Norf\"14. Earl Sweatshirt - \"Grief\"13. Kanye West feat. Paul McCartney, Theophilus London & Allan Kingdom - \"All Day\"12. Drake - \"Back To Back\"11. Kendrick Lamar - \"The Blacker The Berry\"10. Jay Rock feat. Black Hippy - \"Vice City\"Posse cuts remain the domain of the true hip hop head and Jay Rock\u2019s \"Vice City\" is no exception. Black Hippy houses four of the most lyrical and musically talented rappers in the game, including one who sits atop the rap totem pole. And yet, it was Schoolboy Q who came through with the W. While the crew uses the same flow throughout, Groovy Q adds his own spin, throwing shade at himself, while tempering the verse with some braggadocio. The unique flow that Kendrick introduces on the hook immediately grabs attention, and any track that mentions \"cheese eggs\" gets an iron clad stamp of approval. \u2014 Ben Carter\n9. Lupe Fiasco - \"Mural\"As the title suggests, \u201cMural\u201d is a sonic painting. Just hearing the opening keys is enough to provoke a dramatic escape. Lupe doesn't so much invite you into his mind as forcibly drop you there. Entranced by the cadence of repeating piano chords, we're at his mercy. The strain of conscious thought oscillates wildly between existential musings, Freudian slips into childhood, and religious opinion pieces. \u201cMural\u201d is a hip-hop wet dream of lyricism paired with technical ingenuity. \u2014 Ben Carter\n8. Fetty Wap - \"Trap Queen\"\u201cI\u2019m like \u2018Hey, what\u2019s up, hello\u2019\u201d: Very few times has a rapper entered stardom with such welcoming first words. \u201cTrap Queen\u201d is the song that launched Fetty Wap into fame, something he saw coming from the moment he heard the beat. And boy, was he right. The song went on to reach the top 40 in fifteen countries, went platinum in five, and was even the most streamed song of the year on Spotify in the US. The one-eyed trapper\u2019s catchy ode to his \"trap queen\" is one of the most successful songs of the year.\n\u2014 MvdS\n7. Future - \"March Madness\"The haunting piano introduces a pained Future on \"March Madness,\" balancing social commentary with his established ethos. In a year where he made distraught euphoria a tangible feeling, was there any moment more powerful than his howling \u201cFuture Hendrix Dirty Sprite legendary!\u201d, an acknowledgement of the destructive forces that allowed his ascent to legendary status? Though he didn\u2019t completely leave his lane like Pusha T did on the standout \u201cSunshine,\u201d the poignant lines hit hard through the desperation he expressed. Future owned 2015 through his ability to draw multiple guests and subject matters into his orbit, staking the claim for Pluto as its own planet once again. \u2014 Brian Duricy\n6. Travi$ Scott - \"Antidote\"Initially nothing more than \u201cvibes for the summer,\u201d \u201cAntidote\u201d was created as a placeholder for Travis' highly anticipated Rodeo. However upon its immediate popularity, was added to the tracklist last minute, becoming one Travis' most notable songs. The listener is thrust into the passenger seat of Travis\u2019 partying lifestyle the second \u201cAntidote\u201d starts. The rapper\u2019s unique auto-tune infused voice allows him to deliver an infectious summer anthem still being played long after summer's end. \u2014 drxw\n5. Drake - \"Know Yourself\"On the headline song from Drake\u2019s surprise mixtape If You\u2019re Reading This It\u2019s Too Late, Drizzy reminisces and reflects: \u201cRunnin' through the six with my woes!\u201d he raps, the lyric quickly becoming the masses favorite catch-phrase. Co-written by Quentin Miller, this would later ignite controversy (fueled by Meek Mill, among others) claiming Miller and other ghost-writers were the predominant source of Drake\u2019s verses. Simple yet powerful production by hit-makers Boi-1da, Vinylz, and Syk Sense give the song a subtle rhythm that packs heat with every note. \u2014 Cosmos\n4. Kendrick Lamar - \"King Kunta\"To describe the funkalious bassline of \"King Kunta\" as \"toe tapping\" would be like calling Dr. Dre \"quite well off.\" It channels James Brown and Michael Jackson to make your body move in ways you didn't know it could.\nOnly a rapper at the very top of the game could hope to make a track like this. Kendrick is simultaneously furious and braggadocios. He boasts that he smells of \u201cthe powers that be,\u201d and tears into his pseudo-competition: they\u2019re pretending to be his friends whilst cutting him down, sneakily sharing bars, and despite their boasts of greatness, are only providing token competition. After hearing this, a track far beyond the abilities of most artists, it\u2019s hard to disagree. \u2014 Vesuvius\n3. Vince Staples - \"Summertime\"Produced by Clams Casino, the closing track on the first disc of Vince\u2019s debut album Summertime \u201806 is Vince at his most vulnerable. The slowed down, gentle crooning is a drastic change from the harsh, dark style Vince has been known for. It\u2019s honest yearning for companionship and Vince is pouring his heart out in a way we\u2019ve never witnessed before. \u2014 YahwehSolomon\n2. Drake - \"Hotline Bling\"\n\nPackaged just before the deadly \"Charged Up\" on his OVO Sound Radio show, Drake hid a track so infectious even the most hardened pop deniers struggled to make a case against it. Drake didn't need a number 1 hit, he swept pop culture off it's feet once again with simplicity married with undeniable star power. The video was another stroke of genius, ensuring the song lived well past it's used by date via a mountain of memes and cementing Drake at the very top of the pop-rap totem pole. \u2014 Ben Carter\n1. Kendrick Lamar - \"Alright\"\n\nWith a precise melding of gritty vocals and an infectious beat, \u201cAlright\u201d is an activist anthem, manifesting a critical juncture in American society. Like a maestro, Kendrick composed a song reflecting the collective psyche of a generation, fraught at once with both political unrest and a desire for reluctant hope. Although the song was inspired by his trip to Africa, the message is a universal ode of hardship and the subsequent struggle for change.\n\nEven in its lack of particulars, Kendrick does not shy away from making the root of his lamentation clear; specifically naming the police system. While this was met with backlash from some, the song's melodic, chant-like delivery demands to be heard and not silenced, serving as a beacon to the weary; a moment of respite in a year of brutality. Despite this adversity, Kendrick conveys the human spirit as having a resilient characteristic, capable of smiling even in the midst of pain, and fighting on to see another day.\n\u2014 Evelyn Blanco (Freeus)\nCheck out the 20 Best Rap Albums of 2015 here.17Embed",

        "text": "3 ContributorsMy Favorite 100 Songs of 2015 LyricsWith so many songs released by high hitting and underground artists alike, making a list of just 100 songs was near impossible. Flooded with an entire album of irresistible Lupe Fiasco songs, heightened Kendrick Lamar masterpieces, and oh-so many underground favorites, this list has a wider variety than you will find anywhere else. Also check out my joint list with Open Mike Aguila.\n\nHonorable Mentions: Mix It, FACTS & Wonderful\n100. Best Friend by Yelawolf (feat. Eminem)\nWhen Yelawolf \u201csurprised\u201d us with an all country album, this was the only good result. Yela does a great job singing his two verses, and the hard hitting, more alternative hook makes for a great song. Then Eminem rips through with a long, lyrically incredible verse filled with hard hitting lines. Eminem and Yela make a great duo, and this song proves it\nAnd he'll be waiting at the gate when you get sprayed up\nSending you hoes straight up to deal with my (best friend)99. DEATHCAMP by Tyler, the Creator98. Lil' Piggies by Joell Ortiz & !llmind97. Zipporah by Goldlink\nGoldlink works his magic on this deep, thoughtful track. He ponders racism, government and his relationships. But he doesn't get all soft though, he still stays in character and says \"Fuck the world\" still. Great song\n\n96. Institutionalized by Kendrick Lamar (feat. Balil, Anna Wise & Snoop Dogg)95. Angels by Chance The Rapper94. In Da Club by Leather Corduroys\nA futuristic experimental party anthem, maybe even better than the original, where Joey and Kami rock the Kanye flow and make you want to get up and dance\n\n93. Miracle by Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment92. Hood Politics by Kendrick Lamar91. Norf Norf by Vince Staples\n#NORFSIDELONGBEACH\nOne of the best bangers from Vince's album, he returns with a loud, aggressive attack on the ghetto, police, society and apparently: everyone\n\n90. Alcoholics by Skizzy Mars89. Chicken Talk by Leather Corduroys\nOne of the hardest songs from Season, Joey and Kami both lay down their hardest verses yet. They talk gritty \"chicken talk\", filled with double entendres and wordplay. Or should I say: \"birdplay\"\nBird talk good grammar time\nCatch him with that slamma now its slamma time\nCock it back and bang now its hammer time88. Born To Shine by Big Grams (feat. Run The Jewels)87. M.P.A by Pusha T (feat. Kanye West, J. Cole & A$AP Rocky86. Buzz Aldrin by Sahtyre\nAnother LSD inspired, trippy all out lyrical battle rap from the king of battle-rap himself. Sahtyre brings his A-game and completely wrecks the instrumental\n\nWhen you see me, I'll be buzzed like Aldrin!85. Motion Picture by Omen84. Ray Gun by Ghostface Killah & BADBADNOTGOOD (feat. MF DOOM)83. M\u2019$ by A$AP Rocky (feat. Lil Wayne)\nThis song brings Wayne's best verse since A Milli, with a flow and delivery unrivaled. His lyricism is top par, and his electronic, auto-tunes vocals bring something new. Oh, and did I mention Rocky also spits a great verse?\n82. Be Lazy by Skizzy Mars\nBringing \"Netflix and Chill\" to the rap scene, Skizzy once again shares his stoner love story with us. He shows growth in his rapping, and this song is good for endless listens. Follow him as he pops percs, smokes some joints, has sex and gets some girls for his dad. Skizzy once again comes from the underground with a great track\n\n81. King Pt. 4 by Big K.R.I.T.80. Woke Up Dead by MURS79. War by King Los\nLos brings a deep, thought provoking track, and uses the theme of war to detail life in the ghetto\n\n78. Zen Scientist by Milo77. Nelly by Isaiah Rashad76. Feel It by Jay Prince\nAnother feel good song from Jay Prince, he brings back some more funk and shows off his lyrical side. But don't worry, Jay still brings nothing but meaningful, deep lyrics about his childhood, hood mothers and trying to make it out of the hood\n\n75. Know Yourself by Drake74. No More Control by MURS\nAn educated #AllLivesMatter song from underappreciated artist MURS, and with a great hook from MNDR, his message comes through loud and proud. But he keeps his lyrical wits about him, and the song is enlightening for anyone\nWe got to start to take a look in the mirror\nIf we don\u2019t respect ourselves then they always gone fear us\nIf black lives matter then black lives matter\nAnd the color of the killer shouldn\u2019t even be a factor73. On the Bible by Tech N9ne (feat. T.I. & Zuse)Have you ever seen a MAC-11?\nNew TEC-9 with the extension\nHK, AK-47\nMayday, man down, call the reverend\nI put that on the bible boy, count your blessings72. Ps & Qs by Mick Jenkins71. SMUCKER'S by Tyler, The Creator (feat. Kanye West & Lil Wayne)\nAn unlikely group of rappers, Tyler brings together Kanye West and Lil Wayne for great features. Each artist brings their own great verse, and we see 2008 Wayne emerge yet again. Kanye gets in a few quotables, and it's just a great song in general\n\n70. El Chapo by Game (feat. Skrillex)69. Souvenir by Milo\nMilo spits his best rhymes here, with deep, incredibly lyrical concepts that rival Lupe Fiasco. With a left field flow and  great production, Milo proves himself to be one of the best rappers out there right now. If you can understand it, you'll love it, guaranteed\nSo we made a couple sticker packs\nAnd pretended we didn't hear\nWhen white fans said \"nigger\" fast\nUmmm, there's pollo in this menudo68. Grief by Earl Sweatshirt67. Schemes by Lupe Fiasco\nThis epic feat of storytelling by lyrical mastermind Lupe Fiasco, he elevates himself to Slick Rick level storytelling. In this action packed adventure, \"Uncle Lupe\" brings us on a tale of drug dealing, torture and murder, all on the path of becoming a king. But along the way, Lupe discusses racism, pyramid schemes and much,  much more. Such an entertaining listen\n66. The Girls On Drugs by Wale65. Ka-Bang! by CZARFACE (feat. MF DOOM)64. Summertime by Vince Staples\nVince goes over to the emotional side with this dark, depressing track. With a slow, crawling pace and dark delivery, this song might make you cry. The perfect ending to disc one, this is by far one of the best songs on the album. The emotion shows right through, and if you haven't heard it, do so now (with tissues)!\nI know somethings are better left unsaid and people left alone\nPick up the phone, don't leave me alone in this cruel, cruel world63. Rich $ex by Future62. Raw (Might Just) by Young Thug61. Tatted Angel by A$AP Ferg\nA$AP Ferg goes a completely different direction with this serious, emotional song. He talks about his old friends, his relationships, and his father. It's a beautiful thing seeing Ferg so transparent, and it's a spectacle you don't want to miss!\n\n60. RGF Island by Fetty Wap59. 100 (feat. Drake)58. Don\u2019t by Bryson Tiller\nTiller brings one of his best songs yet, where he breaks down his love games with a crooning, Weeknd type rapping. His vocal ranges make the song work so well, it's incredible. With a dope (but short) chopped and screwed verse from Soundcloud rapper King Vory, this song is complete. Another magnificent track from up and coming rapper Bryson Tiller. H-Town got me feeling so throwed!\n57. The City by Skizzy Mars (feat. Phoebe Ryan)\nSkizzy finally properly pays his respects to New York with this upbeat, hopeful bright light anthem. With a very fitting hook courtesy of Phoebe Ryan, this song will have you wishing you were from New York!\nThe big apple took a bite out of me\nLook what I turned out to be56. Polaroids by Jay Prince\nJay Prince get's us to \"feel something\" with this funky, incredibly fun song. With a nostalgic feel that is hard to shake off, and this song is a great fit for the car. It's that funk!\nMake you feel something\nIt's that thing that make you feel so good we keep it bumpin'\nStraight up funky\nIt's that Bump it's that Funk, it's that thing that make you jump55. Like It Is by Vince Staples54. Gang Bang Anyway by Game (feat. ScHoolboy Q & Jay Rock)53. Excuse Me by A$AP Rocky52. Young Jesus by Logic51. Bad Santa by Joell Ortiz & !llmind\nA extremely emotional cut from the dream duo, Joell goes really deep into his most depressing and pressing issues, and with Jared Evan's input, there is no stopping this song. Joell is in his most vulnerable state, but he still keeps it real with wordplay and entendres. This is such a real song, it will make (or ruin, most likely ruin) your day.\nSometimes I wonder if rap is a gift\nEvery 25th he's unwrappin' his gifts\nPardon me if I curse when I'm rappin' and shit\nBut sometimes a fuckin' curse comes wrapped as a gift50. Paper Trail$ by Joey Bada$$49. Vice City by Sahtyre48. M.F.T.R. by Pusha T (feat. The Dream)\nThe-Dream lays down timid-but-beautiful vocals and an amazing hook, while Pusha goes all out with dense wordplay, multiple meanings and harsh delivery. This song goes hard, and proves why Pusha is one of the best in the game\nYou rather be more famous than rich\nPlay your role, it\u2019s easy acting like Mitch\n\u201cPaid In Full\u201d was more than reading a script\nPaid in full is really just being Rich Porter47. Dots & Lines by Lupe Fiasco46. Easy Bake by Jay Rock (feat. SZA & Kendrick Lamar)45. Nightcrawler by Travi$ Scott (feat. Swae Lee & Chief Keef)44. Jump Off The Roof by Vince Staples43. Coco (Remix) by Lil Wayne42. Little Death by Lupe Fiasco41. Jumpman by Drake & Future\nThe unlikely duo of the year's two biggest names strike once again with this banger. Each artist brings their best verses, and by the end it'll leave you singing \"Jumpman jumpman jumpman these boys up to somethin'!\"\n40. 6PM in New York by Drake39. Brokeland by Kirk Knight38. Ocean Skies by Ludacris\nLudacris gets into some of the deepest, most personal stuff ever. He grapples with his father's alcoholism so openly that it may just bring tears to your eyes. But he draws massive parallels between his father's drunken outbursts and loving him dearly. Luda's hard hitting lines cut you deep while Monica sings the heartfelt hook\nYeah, I lost my father to the bottle\nFunctioning alcoholics what they call it far as I know\nBecame a teenager and started to understand\nBut even through drinks he still taught me to be a man37. Paradise by Young Thug36. Panic Room by Sahtyre\nIn this lyrical haze of drugs, partying and a trippy beat, Sahtyre comes in like a beast. With comic wordplay and lot's of double entendres, Saht proves himself to be a worthy foe in today's rap scene. This epic, one verse Lil Wayne rivaling trippy masterpiece is sure to amaze\n\n35. Beast Mode by Ludacris34. Break the Law by Mac Miller\nAnother banger of ridiculous proportions, Miller returns with a extreme hyperbolic, almost comic rampage of rhymes. His obscene lines and punchlines of absurd drug use and ball-grabbing, Miller replicated Eminem on Relapse at times. This is just an awesome song to chill out to anytime\n\n33. Hercules by Young Thug32. Alright by Kendrick Lamar\nOne of the most influential songs of the year, it has been sung in times of need and abuse across the world. This shows what an impact Kendrick can make, and it would be a shame not to have it one here. The anthem of \u201ckeeping your head up\u201d, this song can help anyone through tough times\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nDo you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright31. March Madness by Future30. Canal St. by A$AP Rocky29. They.Resurrect.Over.New by Lupe Fiasco (feat. Ab-Soul & Troi)\nThe dream duo meet up again, and it goes hard. Lupe raps laps around this fast paced, Tron themed track, while Soulo does his best lyrical stoner verse. Both bring heavy wordplay, deep metaphors, and awesome punchlines. With Troi on the dope hook, this song never gets old. The lyrical duo met in heaven, and brought some of it back down to Earth\nMeditate until there's no mind\nDecorate me with shine till I go blind\nBDSM dominated it with no bind\nSafe word is don't stop, both or don't go no times28. Rambo by Bryson Tiller\nSeamlessly switching between hard trap and R&B crooning, Bryson brings his hardest song yet with this banger. Filled with trap-alized sounds of gunshots mixed with his killer hook, Bryson cooked up a real sweet mix. His verses take over to the gritty trap side, but his melodic voice smoothes it all over. With a nice production, Bryson really puts the trap in soul. He fuckin' killed 'em like Rambo!\n\n27. Diamonds Dancing by Drake & Future26. Wesley\u2019s Theory by Kendrick Lamar\n\u201cWesley\u2019s Theory\u201d is the definition of funky. With the beat consisting mainly of wailing G-funk synths courtesy of Flying Lotus and an incredible bassline courtesy of Thundercat, and other elements including a spoken bridge from legend Dr. Dre and amazing guest vocals from George Clinton as well as the aforementioned Thundercat, this song wouldn\u2019t feel out of place at all on a 1990s West Coast rap album. The song is just executed so well overall that I can let Kendrick\u2019s somewhat mediocre chorus slide. In addition, Kendrick\u2019s lyrics and delivery are top-tier. The lyrics sum up the essence of the first section of To Pimp a Butterfly perfectly, with Kendrick rapping about his life goals in a very creative way. In addition, his vocal inflections in the second verse are so perfect that I can\u2019t even get over it. Overall, \u201cWesley\u2019s Theory\u201d is an incredible track and easily one of the best songs of 2015\n-RIPInspectahDUCK\n25. Alchemy by Mick Jenkins\nMick Jenkins completely changed his pace and style with this hard, aggressive song. Rich with wordplay, and continuing his water metaphor, this song goes all the way, taking his best lyrical skills and flow and putting it into this one dope track. Too bad it's so short\n\n24. Often by The WeekndShe asked me if I do this every day, I said \"Often\"\nAsked how many times she rode the wave, \"Not so often\"23. Check by Young Thug22. Pornography by Travi$ Scott21. Madonna (And Other Mothers In The Hood) by Lupe Fiasco\nThe most powerful track off of Tetsuo & Youth, Lupe puts all of his feeling and emotion into this track, and you can feel it. With multiple beautiful hooks from Nikki Jean and lots of nice bridges, Lupe tells two stories simultaneously: the story of Jesus, and the story of a young boy, killed by feinds high off angel dust. With each line being dense with wordplay, metaphor and entendres, and each word hitting hard and home, this is definitely one of Lupe\u2019s best songs. I have never cried from a song before, but every time I hear this song I die a little inside. Man tears, man tears\nThem dope fiends and that water, yeah\nWit' angel dust in they nostrils, yeah\nThey hit em up wit' that chopper\nShe was holdin' him, in her hands\nJust like Stigmata, yeah\nSaid you gon' live here foreverOnly child, the holy mama's your mama now20. Pacifier by Young Thug19. You & The 6 by Drake\nDrake just oozes emotion and love in this personal, vulnerable ode to his mother. It sounds like you are eavesdropping on a private conversation between him and his mother, and believe me, it get's hella personal. Drake has never shown this much of himself in his music before, and it's great. He finally finds the perfect balance between trying to be a big man and crying over the phone\n\n18. No. 99 by Joey Bada$$\nJoey returns from last years hit Christ Conscious with another, more awesome song/ Joey shows us his lyrical power and kills his verses. This is a lyrical war, and Joey is winning\n\n17. u by Kendrick Lamar\nKendrick has proved that he can write uplifting, loving anthems, so now he drags us down to the depths of his despair with this emotion packed song. His vocal range goes to extreme lengths like never before while he cries over a bottle of liquor. He proves why he is such a great artist, this song is so touching that you gotta love it\n\n16. Fine Whine (feat. Future & Joe fox)15. Maria I\u2019m Drunk (feat. Young Thug & Justin Bieber)14. Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye II (LPFJ2) by A$AP Rocky\nThe return of the legend, the badass, the Pretty Flacko. Rocky comes in with an amazing beat, and hard hitting trap lyrics, with wordplay that will make you wanna dance. This song is one of Rocky\u2019s best, and it will have you chanting \u201cFlacko, Jodye\u201d!\nLord Pretty Flacko Jodye\nTell these fuck niggas how you been13. 3230 by Vince StaplesHittin' corners, thuggin' with the blower, barrel louder than a motor\nKeep the engine runnin' when a nigga run up on ya\nAnother day in sunny California12. Untouchable by Pusha T\nPusha T returns with his best track since Numbers On The Boards, absolutely chock full of dense wordplay and intense lyricism. There are no misplaced lines here, and no bad lines either. Pusha shows us why he\u2019s the best lyricist around. Complete with magnificent production and a fitting Biggie Sample, this track can be enjoyed by all rap fans\n\n11. Adoration of the Magi by Lupe Fiasco10. King Kunta by Kendrick Lamar\n\nDescribed by Kendrick before it\u2019s release, he called it \u201cunapologetically black\u201d, and believe me, it is. The best banger off of To Pimp A Butterfly, this song is sure to make your day\n\n9. Money Trees Deuce by Jay Rock\nAfter murdering his verse on the first Money Trees, Rock comes back with an even better one. One of the only good songs on a throwaway album, Rock sounds even more intense and convincing. It brings a much more urgent, running out of time feel, and it\u2019s great. Rock kills it\n\n8. When in Rome by Mac Miller\nMac Miller comes in with a savage, radical  song that goes hard all the way. Mac makes a hell of a banger, the hook is badass, and every line is a outrageous, Relapse-like craziness to it. Non-sequitur after non-sequitur, punchline after punchline\n7. Chopper by Lupe Fiasco (feat. Trouble, Billy Blue, Buk, Glasses Malone, Trae Tha Truth & Famlay)\nLupe brings together seven of the most real, gritty rappers he could find for an insanely gritty track. Sounding nothing like Lupe's usual work, this song bangs hard. The hook is some of the most trap lyrics you will ever hear, and all artists bring their A-game. This track is eleven minutes of pure heaven, and it's hard finding a better track\nMy baby mama done fucked up on her food stamps\nThat\u2019s three muscles recertified6. With That by Young Thug (feat. Duke)Pop me a Xannie I\u2019m fast\nI\u2019m so fast I\u2019m so faster than Sonic man5. Holy Ghost by A$AP Rocky (feat. Joe Fox)\nA$AP Rocky brings us one verse of pure truth. A hyper-realistic depiction of the world we live in today, and it\u2019s dope. Of course, Rocky doesn\u2019t go sparingly on the brags. With harmony and a beautiful hook with Joe Fox, this song goes hard\nChurch bells and choir sounds, tell 'em, \"Quiet down\"\nBow your head, the Most High's around cocktails4. Senorita by Vince Staples (feat. Future)Baby either go hunt or be hunted\nWe crabs in a bucket, he called me a crab\nSo I shot at him in front of the Douglas\nI cannot be fucked with, we thuggin' in public\n\nThis song goes hard, all the way. The Future hook makes you want to get up and fuck someone up, and the whole song is possibly the best banger of 2015. This gritty, thug rap is all killer and no filler\n\n3. Prisoner 1 & 2 by Lupe Fiasco\nAnother great song by Lupe, this time with more feeling and content. He tackles incarceration and racial profiling throughout, and he conveys his emotion well. On Prisoner 2, his anger shines through like on The Blacker The Berry. Lupe keeps the wordplay and metaphors consistent throughout, this song is positively perfect\n2. The Blacker the Berry by Kendrick Lamar\nKendrick Lamar fires back at the world with this harsh, intense, hard and shocking track. He kills three verses with racial, aggressive and badass punchlines before finally shocking us with the biggest twist ending I\u2019ve heard in a long time. His anger is so evident throughout the song and the racial motive throughout rivals Malcolm X. Kendrick displays his emotions even better than in Collect Calls. This track is so incredible, this is why Kendrick is who he is\n1. Mural by Lupe Fiasco\n\nThis is by far the most lyrical song of the year. Maybe of all time. This is just nine straight minutes of complete and utter fire. Double entendre after double entendre, wordplay within wordplay, metaphors within metaphors. With little riddles hidden throughout, and moments of very deep thought and thought inspiring lines. This is the true value of that fire emoji and all those gif\u2019s you keep posting. This is the pinnacle of rap\n\nNote: some songs were singles from 2014, but later featured on 2015 albums, and since they already appeared on last years list I excluded them. And other songs (e.i. Codeine Crazy) were released in late 2014, and didn't make any of last years list so I put them here\n\nClick these sweet links to check out the other stuff:\n\n\n\n1Embed",

        "text": "1 Contributor60 Great Poems By Mario William Vitale LyricsBio Of Mario William Vitale\n\nThe language and images of Mario Vitale's poetry are so closely bound to the natural cycles of seasons, of generations, of the body's functioning, that is surprising to realize how many of his poems deal with uprootedness. But this poetry is not sentimental celebration of the goodness of nature, and harmony with the world is never assumed. The way he captures the tenuousness of this faith, the balance that must be found between the ugliness, the harshness of his history- both natural annd social- and its intense beauty, is what distinguishes Vitale's poetry, gives it its depth and dimension:\n\nMario William Vitale Biography\n\nI was born in 1970 Bristol hospital.\nA young nurse took me in her arms and said that I would one day become a success,\nAs the years would pass I was heavy in the arts used to sing and act.\nWas an altar boy at St. Pius Church.\nIn time I would act in my senior class play, \"The Mystery Of Edwin Drood\"\nWhere I had the lead role as the Narrator,\nI touched many hearts with that performance in 1989,\nWas hospitalized with mono that same year for two weeks long,\nAlso that same year I became prom king of my class Wolcott High School,\nAfter the break up with my first grilfriend in 1989 I wrote the poem entitled, \"Remembrance of a loved one\" where I had it published on poetry.com\nAttempted plays: Tartuffe, Miracle Of St. Anthony and Balm in Gieade, (His poetic aspirations had derived at 18 in 1989 from submitting his first poem entitled, \"Remembrance Of A Loved One\"- (Sparrowgrass Poetry Forum)\nAttended Central Connecticut State University For Creative Writing: 1997\nNext from 1989-1997 (Wrote primarily for Poetry.com and The International Library Of Poetry) , * Received editors choice award in 1997 for poem, \" A Beacon Of Light \",\n(1998)Sent poetic manuscript to N.Y.

Fish bones lay in sun\n\nEach noon the milk fog sank\nfrom cloud cover, came in\nour clothes and held them\ntighter on us. Sea stacks\nstood and disappeared\nThey came back when the sun\nscrubbed out the inlet\n\n\nLife Force\n\nthrough the flame cover me\nin silent sound dignity\nfor with what one is willing to achieve\nvaliantly\nfeel the breeze\nnestled through the trees\n\nshaped through your dreams\na piercing of the skin\nnew hearts to begin\nagain\n\n\nChoices\n\nMany have a hard time understanding\nThey live for self and that of society\nThey are the walking dead yet they don't even know it\nEyes with blackened spots having holes\nViscous fangs with blood dripping off the side\nYou share with them the truth\nThey choose to run away & hide\nYet deep inside they may still question\nWhy am i here ?\nThey can't even help you\nCause they won't help themselves\nThey are the scum of the land\nMuch too afraid to stand among the son of man\nA bitter taste\nDo they want salt or sugar coated messages\nPositive reinforcement strengthens the heart\nNegativity kills it\nEach of us has been given a choice\nWe must lend a helping hand with a voice\nAll of us have been given a choice\nNow which pathway will you choose ?\n\n\nEmerald City\nThere\u2019ll be no unemployment in heaven.\nNo worry about the next meal.\nThere\u2019ll be no bills to harass us,\nand thieves will not break in and steal.\nIn heaven, we\u2019ll have no need for money;\nEverything up there will be free.\nWe\u2019ll enjoy God\u2019s unsearchable riches,\nand have unending security.\nI\u2019m looking forward to heaven,\nthat land that is fairer than day.\nWhere all will be joy and gladness,\nand sorrow and care will flee away.\nUp there, no mean words will be spoken.\nEach heart will be filled with pure love.\nWe\u2019ll never be hurt or rejected,\nin the beautiful city above.\nThere will be no disappointment or heartache.\nGod will wipe all the tears from our eyes.\nNo one will ever be lonely,\nand there\u2019ll be no anguished good-byes.\nUp there, the love we have for each other,\nby each heart will be shared equally.\nAnd we\u2019ll have all the things that we\u2019ve longed\nfor, and at last we will really be free\n\n\nLittle Angel\n\nHope springs a new\nOn a cloud in heaven\nStand a heavenly angel\nWith mere beauty of crystalized light\nGolden emblems encrusted their frame\nSweet songs drifting to a very faint whisper\nEyes, hands & face\nA real message sent down to earth\nTo care for those lonely souls all alone\nThere beauty is a surprise to encounter\nSlipping through locked doors to appear\nMany have shed a tear to numb the inner pain\nCausing accidents not to happen\nThey appear in the form of brightened miracles\nWe see them with a heart all a glow\nCome to the birth of a new born baby\nCome to servicemen who just joined the navy\nYou will see them at a graveyard setting\nEven among gamblers who do there betting\nThere all around us you see\nFor all of life is but a mystery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese Flames I Live\nturn back the tear drop pillow\nI'm sick to my stomach\nsuffering alone and hard\npiercing cavity of viscious fangs that bite\nillusive\nimpulsive\nthe rant\n\nThese flames I live\nmy right to forgive\nundercover\nbeyond the means\nliving in a land of mean\nbarren sea\n\na shot in the dark\nto light the spark\n\nmany are left in rebellion\nwhat an incredible talent Vitale is\nhe is the poet of all poets\nthe moment you met him perfect ten\n\na chick lying with her hens\na quest...\nflaws and failures\nyes he wears Depends\n\na trip to the zoo nothing new\n\n\nLaughter\nLaughter fills the scented air\nthrough days exposed\nthe timeless hour of a loathsome mast\nexpounded upon the cavity of debris\n\ndevelop a grateful heart\nthat one may impart\nlook close through a pillar of glass\na vergence sea out beyond the interpass\n\na halo with a song\nto help you get along\nthe sight of a fawn on the lawn\ngreed and materialism will crush out the light in your life\n\npenetration by the holy spirit\na heart change has to happen\none must be open to the message\ncare for your brother help for your pale sister\n\none ear on the floor\na cause for more\nthrough fetters got it made to even out the score\n\nUnending Brigade\nI ask myself politely\nwhat resistance flowers here\nagainst love treaded lightly\nor losing lovingness dear?\n\ngive cadence to the simple,\nfor I gave ammunition to the laughter\nwe should we ever falter\nthe timeless whisper of happening\n\ngolden nuggets of thought & inspiration\nbraids my hair with a great deal of wear\nthrough the conclaves of love's fastened grip\nshadows block the vortex to aid its message\n\n\nThe Dream Police\nthey come to my head\nat the side of my bed\nthey are enforcing my sleep\ngive cadence to a treat\na far from ports unknown\nlike a dog without a bone\ngiving tickets to be enforced\nevery time I have a dream\nforces scream\n\n\nOf Time & Dreams\nFather's gold pocket watch measured heartbeats,\ntimes for surgery and the slow drip of an IV\nall else in his life was overture\nto main events, like birth and death\nof those the family never knew\n\nSteps from my childhood dreams to his were counted\nin places where treasure were wet pebbles\nand the pulse of life was seen in raindrops on the lake\nnow the watch is mine, and i yearn to throw it\nlike a pebble into the past,\n\nto see it skip and yield to places we never shared,\nlike blue-green eddies near the shore\nand grasses curled by the win\nYet, warming in my palm, the measurer of his days\nseems to sing the music of turning points\nwhere drying dreams meet others born anew,\nemerging through images of caring\nto rhythms more than metrical\nthat i've yet to understand\n\n\n\nThe Land Of Dreams\nWhen you fall asleep at night,\nyour mind goes into an eerie flight\nYou can open the gate with the key of thought,\nand don't have to do what you've been taught\n\nYou sing, and dance, and prance all day\nand you act so happy and also gay\nYou run in circles and run into the trees,\nand cut your elbows and scrape your knees\n\nBut sometimes you open the wrong gate,\nand find yourself facing a terrible fate\nThere are monsters, ghouls and also grouches,\nand then you wish you were on confortable couches\n\nAnd when you're done and almost through,\nyour mind knows exactly what to do\nyou go back through that eerie flight\nit may be day it may be night\n\nAnd when your mind comes back to you,\nyou may wake up and have the flu\nYou could leave for school very late,\nand find out that it's the wrong date\n\nAnd you could play outside in the streams\nbut you will know that you entered \"The Land Of Dreams.\"\n\n\nOld Crow\nOld crow\nTired and lazy' against the day\nDark skies\nLost in blacks and whites and grays\nHowling north wind\nSure takes a man's fight away\n\nWastelands,\nA dreamer's home on his best day\nHard rain\nDrops the leaves and makes the colors fade\nAnd talks cheap,\nBut for the words of time they'll ave the last say\nOh the words of time, they'll have the last say\n\nAnd the harvest is in, it wasn't much\nMay I have enough to get by\nThe baskets were light, not a muscle ached\nAnd somehow I feel I'm going to die\nThe winter is coming and the signs say hard\nI've never seen such a haunting sky\n\nFor on the mountains, frost in the wind\nAnd somehow I feel I'm going to die\nFull moon\nLonely above the old oak tree line\nOld crow\nHanging empty in the black sky\nAnd a nighthawk\nCircles her in silence as she flies\nOld crow, all alone she flies\n\n\nPheonix\nthe blazing glory of a loving night\nDisappears in the sun's bright morning light\nAll efforts to recall that glorious pain\nFade in the dawn to be sought in vain\n\nbut the memory clings of precious glory\nthat will not become an old, dull story\ninstead that memory promises anew\nthat love will spring forth and again renew\n\nwith every joining of two loving souls\nagain will emerge from the fading coals\na love renewed by the glowing embers\nso that this night, too, will be remembered.\n\n\nSoul Search\nWhen I look into your eyes\nI see the sunshine and rain,\nThe deeper I look and also see\nVarious kinds of pain;\nI can see the kind, warm love that filters thru,\nTo surface at the top when you\u2019re not blue,\nI have seen and know your hopes and fears\nThe good and bad times you have thru years,\nYou have seen and felt so much\nI\u2019m glad our lives did touch\nLook deep into my eyes and you will find\nThe heartaches and happiness that were also mine\n\n\nCome With Me\nCome with me and be my friend\nLets create a fantasy\njust you & me\nlets linger through the wind\nand feel free\nlets run through the sand\nand make time stand still\nso we can treasure this moment\nOnly until\nThe mystical ocean\ntouches our souls\nand fills our hearts with love\ncome with me and I'll show you\n\nWhat I have to give\ncome with and I'll describe\nThe life I dreamed we'd live\ncome with and hold me gently\nand watch the retiring sun slowly set\nShower me with all your love\npretending we just met\nWhenever you need me\nI'll be there\nTo help lift your spirits\nand I want to care\nAbout you\ncome with and be my love\nno longer a fantasy\njust you & me\nThis time only\nA reality...\n\n\nMario William Vitale. has been featured on Hubpages.com, Starlitecafe.com & Poetry soup.

Pun sit on you at the same time\nSome guy called Young Thug is wearing dresses\nThat\u2019s not something I have a problem with\nMy problem is\nThere\u2019s so much going on in the world and these rappers are scared to address it\nWhat happened to Hip-Hop when rappers would share a message?\nNas, Big Daddy Kane, Slick Rick, I could name so many more\nNow its a bunch of dudes who sound the same with empty thoughts\nI\u2019d pretend to be from the hood and blast guns but I\u2019d fail\nI\u2019d rather be the real me, and I\u2019m far too cute to go to Jail\nI just love Hip Hop and the way it used to be\nYou always get the truth from me\nsomeone tell Rihanna I\u2019m ready to give her the best 30 seconds of her life\nTell her she\u2019ll only regret it if I become a legend when I die\nKnowing she could of had me\nThis is my last piece of paper, I\u2019m now pad free\nI was watching rap battles on YouTube, So took you on this lyrical experience\nI\u2019m just a poetical lyricist\n\nRapula\nback in the day where hustlers stayed there were those very afraid\nhe was born in the gutter his momma was a vamp selling her junk in the trunk of a car\nup all night slept all day he was blown from the frey\nviscious fangs that bite two turn tables with a mic insisted on a fight\nsucking the innocent patrons for blood right in the hood like you knew he would\nRapula the man, the myth & the legend\ncould very often see him in the back of a seven eleven drinking red slurpees\n\ntook folks block by block like giving him a heart attack just to fit his mold\nno one came against him until that day in the crib Rapula lost his lobster bib\nvery often you will see him at the 8th Street Station spinning his records\nthere will never be another blood sucking brother so move over he's taking cover\nRapula wore a high hat tip on his temple driving a white Benz looking like Baretta\n\n\nI am in the Father, and that the Father is in me\nSupernatural\nbut it's so true\nthe world hasn't a single clue\nborrowed basement pews\nstained glass windows\na reflection of the cross\nsome will go before the toss\n\nhe was there from the beginning\nhe is the only one

reality happens\nRuining my mind that's already jumbled\n\"where the hell did i just go?\"\nI ask to myself no one listens\nObsecurity is still in me\nRecognizing situation where i have been\nLooking up the sky it's already dark\nWorrying something, i need to get up\nHome, i need to find home\nStepping forward to pass the crowd\nThe longer i go, the quieter it's so\nTaking my glasses off because

I love very much.\nAlthough he is so big, he won\u2019t give you a fright,\nHe lifts up his trunk and blesses you instead,\nSo different from the Lion and Tiger you meet,\n\nThere is something about the Elephant I love very much\nHe is a pure vegetarian, he won\u2019t kill a mouse,\nHe is worshiped as God for all his good vice.\nIf we were to crown the king of the jungle again,\nIt will go to the

the mere essence of are existence\nshine your inner light upon the twilight hour\n\nshadows block the mere reflection of my frame\nnot having you in my arms is driving me insane\nlest I refrain

from divorce\nin times of remembrances\nthoughts shattered in the wind\ncoming apart at the seams\n\na brigade of thoughts\nWhat is a funhouse ?\nIt is when the eyes of all are upon you\nIt's not so, but when you go through it is true\n\nThe funhouse is a form of torture where everything unravels around you\nIt is a commotion of nervousness and you just want to hide from all that is around you\nIt is a secret that you don't want to share, but there is one who helps just by saying I care\nIt's not what you say it is what you do\n\nWhen you enter my world of the funhouse, you assure me that God is in control\nthat with him I don't need to be afraid\nIt's the gentle way in which you talk when once you have entered into the realm of commotion...\nIt's the assurance of your sincerity that softens the blow\nSoon with your special way the inner strife goes away\nA Thief in The Night\nJesus\nhe that hath an ear let him hear\nwhen all was said to be good\nlet it be said calamity\n\nhave

them into her cotton ball walls\nBut, beyond her tea-blurred vision and through her pounding heart\n\nShe hears the voice inside her that is worse\nthan a dagger through her heart\nHer shadow's darkest moments are filled with hopeless pride\nAnd her tongue tied conscience is all whom she has to confide\n\nBut the rose that is trying to bloom, within\nher salty hand, will never wither, and never be taken away,\nBecause this, and this alone, is\nwhat keeps her going day by day\n\nthe embrace...\nShelter From The Storm\noutside violence\ninner silence\nshadows now block the vortex\nspaces

flames within your heart\nenter the center of your being pull back on yourself\na still small voice within you saying be not afraid\nI am here I am your heart I abide in the holy temple in the center of your being\n\nyou have climbed through mountains you have found me after a very long trek in the darkness of human misery\nI am the pressence that looks through your eyes\nthe knight will rise of

maiden was on the throne\nruling her army from the barren city\nenclosed was a message of honor\n\nhigh off traction from the waiting pool\nthe kingdom was now silent\nThese Words\nthese words are wrapped among a cordial smile\ncemented like glue for what are we to do\ncome now let us leave the door opened,\na demonstration of trust in a world in quite a bit of a rush\n\nthe door swings wide to the enforced way\na beautiful flower display\nample time to pray\ntherefore everything will be o.k.\n\nthe knock on the door\nlest I implore\na distant shuttter of languished circumstances\nwith a

trust\nSurfing The Internet\nToday I'm on point smoking a fat joint relaxing basking in the ambiance of the hour\nfolks need to take a cold shower as they admire the scented perfume through the room\nwe have become combersome with this world as a child as if you never really heard\nLeonard Cohen with his famed song \"Suzanne\" really makes you think about life.\nThrough the negative light of affliction we have every bit of reason to be standing chosen\nyet we have are back against the wall when all attempts of standing ten feet tall,\n\n\nEach of us has a reason to discuss the mere notion of love sent from up above\nRat tit tat tat on that ass no one gets by on any free pass we need to make are way\nlook to your neighbor for any favors we can all learn to trust & savor\nEach new moment that comes along with a fast paced moving vibrant song\nyou unleashed the inner lion in me with a whole host of chemistry\n\nSurfing the internet may not be your thing but prayer can unleash the fires within\nstorms of life come to either make you or break you whats news for you might not be for you\nlife is like a jagged edge roller coaster with its twists and turns\none soul soars while the other

at the arcade park my Benz in back\nfolks tend to over react but I tip my hat got news for you all bridge the gap know what's up\n\nChilling at the grill with my girl sporting heavy studs think that I'm in love you see\nthere's brilliance in a piece mark the ege of my teeth stand still & repeat\nbars watching souped up body kit cars looking to the stars a view from Mars\nPina Colada does anyone grow fond of Starsky & Hutch another push\n\ngrasping with tender faith in my hand when will folks understand stick it to the man\nyears have passed still having every reason to grasp the solitude in that I'm still in a good mood...\nFeeling high anxiety got folks sitting next to me living out my legacy of what I used to be\nSipping my favorite sauce to the max you tend to over react got to stay in the zone\n\nSummer time boogy time get your cash and stand in line frozen in time\nThrough a variation of a dream peeps do scream eating delicious ice cream\nSouped up high hat as if in a tempo taking you places that you need to go\nplaying a little Spanish fly i got words by the fly your my favorite guy\n\non my human side stand still I'm happily alive got to put first things first\nthis is how i flirt got words for Lavert put back your gold in a purse\nTrump is getting busy but he makes me awful dizzy better listen to Thin Lizzy\nthey say i'm institutionalized but I got words from the hive it's best to dream big\nLet Yourself Be\nA reflection I will be, for today\nI looked into a mirror and much to my surprise,\nwhat I saw was all deep, deep, inside...\nThere it was, all exposed, the inner me\n\nright down to my very soul alarmed, shocked, and surprised, what\nI saw wasn't really me on the outside\nWhat have I done ? Where did it go wrong ?\nWhy isn't the inner me the same as the outer soul ?\n\nThen I could see way beyond it isn't just me, but everyone.\nLife is a fairy tale to most for the really don't accept the Holy Ghost\nIf all would look within their self, and\nsee the person that is there,\n\nopen up your heart, let it out\ndon't pretend, just be proud, for the person\nyou really are, is just what God wanted\nfor he created you as he chose\n\nDon't fret, or whine, just be proud, life's riches you will surely find\nNow when you look at me, a mirror you will see\nfor when you look at me, what you'll see is the inner me\nFor I am the mirror of the real me\n\nTo everyone in life who feels they are not special,\nyou really are, you see, for God made you that way,\nif you'll only let yourself be...Embed",

Why you trying to go Live?\nI'ma miss the Obamas, I don't wanna see them go\nMy prayers to everyone that we lost in Orlando\nThe Oscars were so white they had to get Chris Rock\nAnd the album of the year had to be Anderson.Paak\nCubs finally Won, Usain was on fire\nMelania Trump hired the wrong ghostwriter\nI'm petty with the manners\n'Cuz I think Kim K. got robbed by Joanne the Scammer\nOoouuu\nBiters keep testin' me\nThey making rap ups, but they ain't got the recipe\nHuh, Yeah that's facts\nShout to Young M.A. for bringing New York back\nAnd I hear y'all talking about \"Kanye is fine\"\nWell to us it look like Kanye lost his mind\nCowboys kept ballin', them boys in the zone\nBryson Tiller came along, kept telling us \"Don't\"\nI'm highly favored\nI clap back on my haters\nI feed em beans, greens, potatoes, tomatoes\nThe mannequin challenge, oh, that's how y'all feel?\nThe World moving dog, we can't just stand still\nBeyonce made sure y'all got in formation\nOne time for Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation\nDid Drake bag J.Lo? I say kinda\nBut y'all was all up in arms over Rob and Chyna\nAnd that's a new level of female pimping\nBiggest L of the year goes to Hillary Clinton\nYou ask me, man, I thought she had it made\nYou ask me now, shit, I think we all got played\nAnother sign of the times\nAnd now the whole World laughing at us, sounding like ChewbaccaMom\n2016 was a bully and a punk\nOn top of that, now we gotta deal with Donald Trump?\nPardon me, as I vent\nBro, we made a reality star the President\nAnd that just makes me sick\nTalking about, \"We gotta give him a chance.\" Naw\nI ain't got to give him shit\nIt's going to be hard to cope\nBecause you can't have progress, dog, if you don't have hope\nMore pros, less rookies\nAnd if America's ours, how we let it get grabbed by the pussy?\nThey say I sound mad, off the cuff\nOh, I sound mad? Y'all don't sound mad enough\nSo from here on out, we gotta set the tone\nY'all protect yourself and protect your own\nAnd way too many people got called back home\n2016 you can go, and I'm glad you're gone\nFelt like a long bad dream\nI'm wishing you love and life, Welcome to 2017You might also like1Embed",

        "text": "173 ContributorsTop 100 Rap Songs of 2014 Lyrics100. Ghostface Killah ft. AZ, Kool G Rap &  Tre Williams \"The Battlefield\"\"The Battlefield\" is an amazing portrayal of hip-hop's recent evolution. The genre is starting to age, and so are its key musicians. Mafioso rap veterans Ghostface, AZ and Kool G take their adulthood experiences and apply them to the metaphorical battlefield. Never forget - there's a war going on outside.99. Apollo Brown & Rass Kass ft. Pharoahe Monch & Rakaa Iriscience \"H20\"98. Travi$ Scott ft. Big Sean \"Don't Play\"97. Mac Miller ft. Vince Staples \"Rain\"96. Isaiah Rashad ft. SZA \"West Savannah\"95. Vic Mensa\t\"Feel That\"Following his breakout mixtape Innanetape and four appearances on last year\u2019s top 100 song list, Vic Mensa is back with his Smoko Ono produced banger \"Feel That\". The song breaks away from Vic\u2019s reputation as a \u201clyrical\u201d rapper, substituting lyrical complexity for a strong flow and crazy energy. Vic\u2019s about to take over the game and we feel that!94. Mick Jenkins\tft Joey Bada$$ \"Jerome\"93. Tinashe ft Schoolboy Q \"2 On\"92. Jay Electronica ft. LaTonya Givens \"Better In Tune With The Infinite\"91. Big K.R.I.T. \"King Of The South\"90. PRyhme \"Courtesy\" In classic Premo style, the production is lead by organs and 90's scratched vocal samples. Royce blesses us with two thrilling verses - snarky shots at his competition, sprinkled pop culture references, and packed wordplay. Rapping well is the only way he knows how, and it proves true on this record.89. Childish Gambino \"Sober\"88. NehruvianDOOM \"OM\"87. Drake\t\"How About Now\"86. Statik Selektah ft Action Bronson, Royce da 5'9 & Black Thought \"The Imperial\"85. O.T Genasis\t\"CoCo\"BAKIN' SODA, I GOT BAKIN' SODA!O.T took the internet by storm with this cocaine ballad. His hilariously serious tone combined with references to Nemo and Nino Brown made us all fall in love with the coco, even Nicki Minaj. The biggest fans of this song are O.T's peers - y'all saw what happened to Busta Rhymes, right?84. Vince Staples ft James Fauntleroy \"Nate\"83. Lupe Fiasco ft Ty Dolla $ign \"Deliver\"82. Theophilus London ft Kanye West \"Can't Stop\"81. Future ft. Andre 3000 \"Benz Friends (Whatchutola)\"80. Jay Electronica ft. Jay Z \"We Made It Freestyle\" Jay Electricity and Hova joined forces at the top of the  year to murder Drake & Soulja Boy\u2019s 2013 New Year anthem \u201cWe Made It\u201d. The chemistry is undeniable as the two flow effortlessly over the blaring horns. While both dropped serious knowledge on The Five Percent Nation of Islam, every line packs a punch. Exhibit A? Jigga hitting Drizzy square in the jaw with this right hook: \u201cSorry Mrs. Drizzy for so much art talk/Silly me rappin' 'bout shit that I really bought\u201d79. Beyonce ft. Nicki Minaj \"***Flawless Remix\"78. ScHoolboy Q \"Prescription/Oxymoron\"77. Travis Scott ft Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug \"Mamacita\"76. YG ft. Jay Rock & ScHoolboy Q \"I Just Wanna Party\"75. Dej Loaf\t\"Try Me\"From the moment the muted twinkles of DDS\u2019 \u201cTry Me\u201d beat creeps in, Dej commands the year\u2019s most threatening anthem without ever raising her voice past a Cam\u2019ronian monotone. It runs like a checklist of guaranteed hip-hop success. Hook? Infectious. Flow? Unique, yet copyable by the lay listener. Lyrics? Quotable. But what exalts this song to its heights is Dej Loaf\u2019s undeniable, next-level swagger, one that makes her one rapper you really might not want to try.74. Young Thug ft. A$AP Ferg & Freddie Gibbs \"Old English\"73. Lil Wayne ft. The LOX \"Gotti\"72. Mick Jenkins \"The Waters\"71. Game \"Bigger Than Me\"70. Childish Gambino \"Candler Road\"Bino pays homage to a road in his hometown in Decatur, Atlanta, a fitting name for an instrumental that contains an interpolation of his because the internet song \u201cTelegraph Ave.\u201d The improvised scat hook puts a cherry on top of the seemingly effortless track that stands out as his best rap song of the year.69. Wu-Tang Clan \"Ruckus In B Minor\"68. Kendrick Lamar \"Untitled\"67. OG Maco \"U Guessed It\"66. Drake \"Draft Day\"65. Donnie Trumpet ft. Chance The Rapper & Jamila Woods\t\"Sunday Candy\"The Social Experiment, a.k.a the Chicago \u201csymphony\u201d, switches things up to make a truly heartwarming track. Whether it\u2019s the soul-filled vocals from Jamila Woods & Co, or Chance the Rapper\u2019s two verses, nostalgia oozes out of every corner of this joint. With live instrumentation and composition by SoX, this release sets expectations high for their album SURF.64. ScHoolboy Q \"Hoover Street\"63. Common ft. Vince Staples \"Kingdom\"62. Jay Rock \"Parental Advisory\"61. Freddie Gibbs \"Shitsville\"60. Action Bronson \"Easy Rider\"The psych-rock sampling accompanies Bronsolino's timeless flow like a hot dog at the ball game. Gems like \u201cI had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans. Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin\u201d are classic Bam Bam. \"Easy Rider\" is Mr. Wonderful's acid trip on steroids.59. Eminem\t\"Shady XV\"58. Nicki Minaj \"Anaconda\"57. J.Cole \"January 28th\"56. Run The Jewels ft. boots \"Early\"55. Mac Miller \"Diablo\"Mac hit us with \u201cDiablo\u201d  on his Soundcloud account out of nowhere in February. The chilling piano line and Mac's delivery perfectly complement lyrics like \u201cContemplating suicide like it\u2019s a DVD / Lost inside my mind, it\u2019s a prison homie leave me be\u201d. The druggy philosopher we all fell in love with is back, and trippier than ever. 54. Freddie Gibbs \"Harold's\"53. Slaughterhouse \"Y'all Ready Know\"52. Logic \"Nikki\"51. Yelawolf \"Till It's Gone\"50. Pharoahe Monch ft. Black Thought \"Rapid Eye Movement\"From the moment the first bar is spat, you know Pharoahe and Tariq aren't strangers to the rap game. \"My think tank's like a piranha tank think, multiple bites figure / Mega, reality, tera, giga\" starts us off with a bang. \"Rapid Eye Movement\" sounds like it belongs in a James Bond movie49. PartyNextDoor ft. Drake \"Recognize\"48. Vic Mensa \"Down On My Luck\"47. PRyhme\t\"PRyhme\"46. Vince Staples \"Blue Suede\"45. Rae Sremmurd\t\"No Flex Zone\"Serving as Rae Sremmurd's debut single, this anthem quickly blew up the charts, clubs and streets to make the oddly named duo the biggest thing in hip hop. In fact, this track was so big that the remix featured two of the hottest rappers in recent times: Nicki Minaj and Pusha T44. Nicki Minaj ft. Chris Brown, Drake & Lil Wayne \"Only\" 43. Joey Bada$$\t\"Big Dusty\"42. Run The Jewels \"Blockbuster Night Pt. 1\"41. Big K.R.I.T.\t\"Cadillactica\"40. Pusha T \"Lunch Money\"What started as an accidental release turned out to be one of the best joints of the year. The G.O.D laid down the Contra style soundtrack, while King Push\u2019s flow was flawless. The drug dealer dichotomy did it again with lines like \u201cWhat's the price of success? Lost my bitch, bought a chef\u201d. This initial offering has us fiending for King Push, and unlike 2013\u2019s MNIMN, he won\u2019t need a pitch either - the shit sells itself.39. YG ft. Drake \"Who Do You Love\"38. Freddie Gibbs \"Deeper\"37. Mac Miller ft. Da$h & Earl Sweatshirt \"New Faces V2\"36. Rae Sremmurd \"No Type\"35. Isaiah Rashad \"Heavenly Father\"Here Isaiah Rashad delivers dark content over a soulful instrumental, creating a nice contrast between the two. A combination of Rashad's smooth, low-tempo flow, and a melodic hook from SZA, makes this for a heavenly performance. One of the best cuts from Cilvia Demo.34. Wiz Khalifa \"We Dem Boyz\"33. J.Cole \"No Role Modelz\"32. Future ft. Casino, Pharrell Williams & Pusha T \"Move That Dope\"31. Logic \"Soul Food\"30. Eminem ft. Big Sean, Danny Brown, Dej Loaf, Royce Da 5'9 & Trick Trick \"Detroit Vs Everybody\" Detroit up-and-comers Big Sean and Danny Brown come hard enough to successfully bridge the gap between Royce and Em\u2019s bookend verses. Between another show-stealing verse from Royce, a solid hook from Dej Loaf, and an outro from the director of the \u201cNo Fly Zone\u201d Trick Trick, this track should keep rival MCs wary of Detroit static for time to come.29. Jay Rock ft. Chantal Kreviazuk & Kendrick Lamar \"Pay For It\"28. Nas \"The Season\"27. Bad Meets Evil \"Vegas\"26. Logic \"Gang Related\"25. Freddie Gibbs ft. Danny Brown \"High\"Gangster Gibbs brings Danny on a marijuana-filled trip, backed with smooth and bass-banging production courtesy of Madlib. Getting high is what they do best, and it's no surprise hearing how well both of them sound on this joint. As expected, Danny's excited and high-registered verse flows perfectly with the beat as Freddie refuses to extinguish the fire.24. T.I ft. Young Thug \"About The Money\"23. Drake \"6 God\"22. Eminem ft. Sia \"Guts Over Fear\"21. Run The Jewels ft. Zack de la Rocha  \"Close Your Eyes (And Count To Fuck)\"20. Mick Jenkins \"Jazz\" Mick rides the beat using his notorious voice conviction skills, and as the beat mellows, his voice mellows; as the beat gets more chaotic, his voice rises. The lyrics, flow, and overall vibe of the song hits your soul and makes a new home. Mick wants us to ignore the lies and corruption in the world - and we already know that this black man ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 all that Jazz.19. Young Jeezy ft. Jay Z \"Seen It All\"Two of hip hop's most renowned hustlers join forces yet again and the result is nothing short of astonishing. The track is a clear highlight on Jeezy's album and one of Jay's finest verses in recent memory. They are both in top form as they vividly depict the experiences of their past drug dealings. You can clearly tell there's a genuine chemistry between the two. Even if you say this song blows - that's still a compliment. It was so real Jay was brought to tears while writing his verse.18. Rick Ross ft. Big Sean & Kanye West \"Sanctified\"Ross gruntFeaturing Big Sean and Kanye West in addition to production by DJ Mustard and West, \"Sanctified\" was easily the most anticipated track from Rozay's 6th album, Mastermind. While Kanye's verse was a PSA to the critics who continually attempt to tarnish his reputation, Ross rapped about grilled cheese and his Rolls Royce Wraith.\n\nNot only did \"Sanctified\" appear #1 on our Top 10 Beats of 2014 list, but it served as the background music for the greatest viral video of all time17. ILOVEMAKONNEN ft. Drake \"Tuesday (Remix)\"I Love Makonnen began 2014 as a relatively unknown artist struggling to gain relevance as a musician, and trying to break free from his manslaughter charges. Then one day...Drizzy decided to drop a verse onto \u201cTuesday\u201d and nothing was the same. Makonnen sings about his drug dealing past, and his busy schedule forcing him to bend the rules of when clubs can go up. Thanks to this single, clubs will never be the same on a Tuesday.16. J.Cole \t\"Wet Dreamz\"Over a classic sample, Cole gives us his vintage story telling as he reminisces about his first time with a girl. He holds a cool attitude as tells the girl he's a pro - even though he's never had sex before. As thing escalate further, he watches porn videos for pointers and practices putting on a condom before the plot takes a twist right at the end. What's scary is how well this song relates. We guarantee almost every male listener felt some type of way. 15. Lil Wayne ft. Drake \"Believe Me\" The release of \"Believe Me\"  raised Tha Carter V's hype up few notches thanks to the perfect combination of YMCMB's finest. Drake lays down the hook and two stylistically different verses; one that bounces perfectly with the Boi-1da-produced beat, and another with a gritty flow. Wayne matches Drake verse-for-verse and ends the track in memorable fashion\n\nOne of the more underrated aspects of \"Believe Me\"  is its versatility. You can bump it while you\u2019re browsing Genius, driving to work or school, or grinding through a workout. It appeals to all ears, just as we hope the entire album will.14. ScHoolboy Q \"Break tHe Bank\"Complete with a chilling piano line and a Mario Kart 64 sample from The Alchemist, the instrumental is perfect for a modern gangster rapper like ScHoolboy Q. Throughout the track he viciously reminds the listener that it's his time and that he ain't no one to fuck with. With Oxymoron debuting at number one on the billboard charts, and having sold over 320,000 copies, it is safe to say that Q is Breaking the bank. 13. A$AP Rocky ft. Juicy J \"Multiply\"After some uncharacteristic features, A$AP returned with one of the hardest hitting songs of the year in \"Multiply.\" The Flacko flow is on full display from the start; his signature internal rhyming bounces up and down on the beat with such rhythm that it wouldn\u2019t matter if he used to sell crack or lemonade in his living room\n\nDon\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be seeing an A$AP Lemonade Stand anytime soon as Rocky sticks to his typical rapper and fashion references. Throw in some Juicy J trash talk for good measure and A$AP\u2019s only single since Long.Live.A$AP is one of the year\u2019s best. Swag swag.12. Flying Lotus ft. Kendrick Lamar \"Never Catch Me\"Like a psychedelic rat race, \u201cNever Catch Me\u201d  has Kendrick Lamar running circles around this Flying Lotus masterpiece. The fusion of hip hop, jazz, & electronic styles has Kendrick spazzing like a rabid dog. The L.A natives take you on an outer body experience to stare death right in the face. Every few bars the instrumental changes as the race continues, like Kendrick\u2019s searching for something, getting faster, and faster, and as you reach your destination - \u201cbitch, you\u2019re dead!\u201d11. Joey Bada$$ \"Christ Conscious (Toroidal Flow)\"With an aggressive flow, Joey delivers a barrage of punchlines, wordplay, and utter energy that dazzles any listener. The beauty of these lyrical acrobats continues to prolong Joey\u2019s ability and shows he ain\u2019t no slacker when it comes down to the lyrics. Dragon Balls like his name was Vegeata, BADA$$  swears that no matter what, he won\u2019t stop until he reaches the level of Christ Conscious.10. Run The Jewels \"Oh My Darling Don't Cry\" Anchored by an El-P instrumental that can only be described as manic, the dynamic duo laces the beat with rhymes that are crude, insightful, and simultaneously both. What separates it from other RTJ tracks is the erosion in differences between the styles and personalities of the lead rappers. On RTJ1, Mike and El were characterized as aggressive and philosophical, respectively. But here El has no problem telling you to \u201crun backwards through a field of dicks\u201d as Mike peruses Egyptian scriptures. The chemistry is palpable, the flows are indescribable, and the result is one of the highlights of 2014.9. Rich Gang ft. Birdman, Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug \"Lifestyle\" EUUGHBLAHBEAHELGWLINAHDEWFQLFKQWFN LLLLLLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEEEEEESTYLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEFor a song that made many detractors reconsider Rich Homie Quan\u2019s \u201cone-hit wonder status\u201d and mainstream listeners delve into the Young Thug archives, the unintelligible nature of the lyrics for most listeners was its greatest asset: whatever personal details you added over the beat, you felt like your efforts were putting you on the fast-track to a Dionysian lifestyle of your own.8. ScHoolboy Q ft. BJ The Chicago Kid \"Studio\"ScHoolboy Q put his heart on his sleeve in this banger for the ladies, elaborating on the reality that life as a major musician can be hectic. From touring around the world to TV appearances to, in this case, late nights in the studio, it can be hard to balance a relationship with a busy work schedule.7. J.Cole \"Fire Squad\"If shock factor was what Cole was after with \"Fire Squad\" then he certainly achieved it. After boasting of his greatness in the first two verses, he took an interesting approach: highlighting white appropriation in the music of black culture. Not only did he just observe the sound-jacking, he name dropped some of the most well-known artists to ever do it.6. Bobby Shmurda \"Hot Nigga\"The relationship between artist and subject matter, in the hip-hop and r&b genres especially, is a dangerously liminal one. When Rick Ross gets chastised for portraying a criminal mastermind following his career in law enforcement, are we supposed to then turn around and congratulate Bobby Shmurda and his crew for their string of summer smashes for existing in a realm of authenticity? It wasn\u2019t the lyrics, nor the beat (on its second go-around, no less!) that made Bobby so hot. So when the chant-worthy one-liners become appear as more than fiction, should we cheer? Should we scold? Or should we Shmoney Dance the troubles away?!5. Logic \"Under Pressure\"The title track of the album is reminiscent of Logic\u2019s classic brag pieces, entailing his recent rise in popularity and success. Where the initial four-minute release dropped off is the track\u2019s elegant yet radical style shift - it transitions from his recent material success to a deeply introspective track reflecting on both his past and current state of affairs with family. This track serves as the crown jewel of the album - a diamond created from being under pressure.4. Big Sean ft. E-40 \"I Don't Fuck With You\"Sean Don and Bay Area godfather E-40 went big this year with the anthem for those without fucks to give. This track dropped along with \u201cParadise\u201d, \u201c4th Quarter\u201d, and \u201cJit/Juke\" through his website following the announcement of his signing to Roc Nation. The song samples \u201cSay You Love Me\u201d, as part of the exemplary accompaniment of Coach Kanye and DJ Mustard on the beat. His blatantly vulgar lyrics clearly express his lack of interest in those he is not \"down with\" and is reminiscent of \u201cI Don\u2019t Give A Fuck\u201d from Bo$$. While it has been confirmed that the record is not meant to be a shot to anyone in particular (including Naya Rivera with whom he recently split,) the message is still\u2026.Who ever I don't fuck with, I still don't fuck with you.3. Big K.R.I.T.\t\"Mt. Olympus\"Post KRIT's 2013 release, King Remembered In Time, more verbal lightning from Krizzle became high in demand, and he delivered. \"Mt. Olympus\" sees K.R.I.T. punish all the heathens of the rap game, showing them there really is a god. The fans wonder, \"Is he rap, is he snap?\". \"Is he bass, is he drank?\" Neither - he is a King Remembered in Time.2. Drake \"0-100/The Catch Up\"If there's one thing we've learned, it's that every song really does sound like Drake featuring Drake. \"Started from the bottom, now we here\" may have been 2013's catchphrase, but \"0 to 100 nigga, real quick\" took 2014 over almost as quickly as fans grabbed the free Soundcloud download of this track after its June release\n\nThe two-part track is a variety pack, filled with braggadocio, meme-worthy lines, and introspective thoughts. What makes \"0 to 100/The Catch Up\" so notable is the instantaneous shift from straight fire bars to a calmer profession of the same sentiment: Drake is perched at the top of the rap game and he's only getting better. That's a scary thought. We've already begun to see Drake back up these claims in his latest releases, and it's safe to say the anticipation for his next full-length project is nearly off the charts.1. Kendrick Lamar \"i\"Backed by funky production reminiscent of the wonder years of soul music, Kendrick broadcasts a message of self love.  The best messages are those easily understood, and Kendrick makes no mistakes with a simple \"I love myself\"\n\nSimilar to our number one song last year, Kanye West's \"New Slaves\", every facet of the song\u2019s concept was handled in one spectacularly orchestrated move. Whether it be the record, the music video, or the buzz - each element illustrates the message crystal clear. An anthem isn't created overnight, this song has been in Kendrick all his life. They can lock ya body, they can\u2019t trap ya mind.\n163Embed",

Do the scars really heal up?\nFrom all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)\nA week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)\nLeft his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side\nHe seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes\nTo see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)\nEven let him get the last meal\nHe done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)\nHe gotta show him that it's that real\nHe ran up on him with the pipe like, \"****, stand still\" (Jesus)\n\"You took my brother life, you made my mother cry\" (Lord)\n\"Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ\"\nHe said, \"Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ\"\nThen big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus, Lord)\nYou might also like[Chorus: Kanye West]\nTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)\n\n[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]\nUh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful (Hallelujah)\nThank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertu\u011frul (Jesus)\nEvery knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)\nTo the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Shoo)\nIt's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor\nBack from the great beyond like the Son of Man or the Son of Donda? (Jesus)\nI never rolled the GSXR or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)\nBut I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda\nEarthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)\nWhat the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)\nIn Tepoztl\u00e1n, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)\nI shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal\nThe God is interstellar while you fellas remain local\nMy bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)\nAs sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)\nI could change the world like Yacub with two pieces of steel\nMy sword and my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne\nBut when you great, they wanna say you took a L, Jos\u00e9 Castillo (Jesus)\nI'm in the fight here, fight here for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)\nMy rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears\nThirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier\nIt's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)\nIt's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)\nNow we've been through a lot of things\nTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)\nHe lives in a lot of things\nTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)\nBeen through a lot of things\nTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)\n\n[Outro: Larry Hoover Jr. & Kanye West]\nWhat up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr\nFirst and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office\nYou might not have been the only one that could've did that\nBut you were the one that did do that\nAnd with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight\nYou know, to me, it kinda feels like\nMe, my mother, my brothers, and my kids\nHave all been incarcerated through this journey\nAnd we haven't even been to jail\nWe have been looked at and treated as criminals\nFor being a part of this family\nMy father's truth and the reality that he raised me in\nIs that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)\n'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him\nAnd it is what made the children of today\nAfter twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one\nMy father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world\nAnd will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples\nIf my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction\nInto the Hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years\nMan, he would be dead to me\nI didn't sign up for that\nI didn't stay on this journey this long for that\nAll my life, man\nI've been waitin' for my father to come home\nThey told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home\nThen they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home\nI went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home\nNow I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated\nHe still not home\nNow even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'\nMatter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren\nAnd they haven't been able to touch they grandfather\nEven though it is not seen that way for some of us\nBut for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community\nWho deserves to breathe free air\nFree my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)64Embed",

        "text": "19 ContributorsUlysses (Chap. 17 - Ithaca) LyricsWhat parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?\n\nStarting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner's place by an inadvertance as far as the farther corner of Temple street, north: then at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George's church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.\n\nOf what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?\n\nMusic, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glow-lamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen's collapse.\n\nDid Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?\n\nBoth were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to plastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.\n\nWere their views on some points divergent?\n\nStephen dissented openly from Bloom's view on the importance of dietary and civic self help while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen's views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom assented covertly to Stephen's rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt (266 A.D.) suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation, Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman's hand.\n\nWas there one point on which their views were equal and negative?\n\nThe influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.\n\nHad Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?\n\nIn 1884 with Ower Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard's corner and Leonard's corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue. In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross. In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon's house in Roundtown. Once in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom's) house in Lombard street, west.\n\nWhat reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885, 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?\nHe reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.\n\nAs in what ways?\n\nFrom inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.\n\nWhat action did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?\n\nAt the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.\n\nWas it there?\n\nIt was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.\n\nWhy was he doubly irritated?\n\nBecause he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.\n\nWhat were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?\n\nTo enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.\n\nBloom's decision?\n\nA stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement, and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.\nDid he fall?\n\nBy his body's known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Fraedman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the Christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammedan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number $, epact 13, solar cycle 9, dominical letters C B, Roman indication 2, Julian period 6617, MXMIV.\n\nDid he rise uninjured by concussion?\n\nRegaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, ignited a Lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle.\n\nWhat discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?\n\nReclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 C P, a man lighting a candle, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle of ICP.\n\nDid the man reappear elsewhere?\n\nAlter a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.\n\nDid Stephen obey his sign?\n\nYes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man's back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom's house.\n\nWhat did Bloom do?\n\nHe extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M'Donald of 14 D'Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.\n\nOf what similar apparitions did Stephen think?\nOf others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher's Island: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis-Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics' theatre of university College, 16 Stephen's green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father's house in Cabra.\n\nWhat did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?\n\nUnder a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies' grey hose with lisle suspendertops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.\n\nWhat did Bloom see on the range?\n\nOn the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.\n\nWhat did Bloom do at the range?\n\nHe removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.\n\nDid it flow?\n\nYes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2,400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of #5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee, had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the importable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.\n\nWhat in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier returning to the range, admire?\n\nIts universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator's projection: its umplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding 8,000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: Its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including billions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents: gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs, and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe) numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.\n\nHaving set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?\n\nTo wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington's lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.\n\nWhat reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom's offer?\n\nThat he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.\n\nWhat impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach, and thenar or sole of foot?\n\nThe incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.\n\nWhat additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?\n\nDietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.\n\nWhich seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?\n\nConfidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation.\n\nWhat concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?\n\nThe phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise I pound of water from 50\u00b0 to 212\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\n\nWhat announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?\n\nA double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.\n\nFor what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?\n\nTo shave himself.\n\nWhat advantages attended shaving by night?\n\nA softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman's double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered which was to be done.\n\nWhy did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noises\n\nBecause of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.\n\nWhat quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?\n\nThe operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.\n\nWhat lay under exposure on the lower middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser opened by Bloom?\n\nOn the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, and open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic violet comfits. On the middle shelf a chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of Plumtree's potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and Co's white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue paper, a packet of Epps's soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch's choice tea at 2/- per lb. in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish, bisected with augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairy's cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a noggin and a quarter of soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr Bloom's and Mrs Fleming's breakfasts made one imperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak. On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars of various sizes and proveniences.\n\nWhat attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?\n\nFour polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered 887, 886.\n\nWhat reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?\n\nReminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the Evening Telegraph, late pink edition, in the cabman's shelter, at Butt bridge.\n\nWhere had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?\n\nIn Bernard Kiernan's licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street: in David Byrne's licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in O'Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon's when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F. W. Sweny and Co (Limited) dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M. (Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the Freeman's Journal and National Press which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.\n\nWhat qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?\n\nThe difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.\n\nHis mood?\n\nHe had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.\n\nWhat satisfied him?\n\nTo have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to others. Light to the gentiles.\n\nHow did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?\n\nHe poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps's soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.\n\nWhat supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?\n\nRelinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).\n\nWas the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?\n\nHis attention was directed to them by his host jocosely and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps's massproduct, the creature cocoa.\n\nWere there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?\n\nThe reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right side of his guest's jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the four lady's handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.\n\nWho drank more quickly?\n\nBloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation ad taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent's one, six to two, nine to three.\n\nWhat cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?\n\nConcluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.\n\nHad he found their solution?\n\nIn spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing on all points.\n\nWhat lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering of three prizes at 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively by the Shamrock, a weekly newspaper?\n\nAn ambition to squint\nAt my verses in print\nMakes me hope that for these you'll find room.\nIf you so condescend\nThen please place at the end\nThe name of yours truly, L. Bloom.\n\nDid he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?\n\nName, age, race, creed.\n\nWhat anagrams had he made on his name in youth?\n\nLeopold Bloom\n\nEllpodbomool\n\nMolldopeloob.\n\nBollo edoom\n\nOld Ollebo, M. P.\n\nWhat acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic poet) sent to Miss Marion Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?\n\nPoets oft have sung in rhyme\nOf music sweet their praise divine.\nLet them hymn it nine times nine.\nDearer far than song or wine,\nYou are mine. The world is mine.\n\nWhat had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R. G. Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual years, entitled If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime Sinbad the Sailor (written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George A. Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan, produced by R. Shelton 26 December 1892 under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist principal girl?\n\nFirstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded 1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses, the duke and duchess of York (real), and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary); thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist's non-intellectual, non-political, nontopical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist's revelations of white articles of nonintellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from Everybody's Book of Jokes (1,000 pages and a laugh in every one); sixthly, the rhymes homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton.\n\nWhat relation existed between their ages?\n\n16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen's present age Stephen was 6.16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom's present age Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom, being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in the year 81,396 B.C.\n\nWhat events might nullify these calculations?\n\nThe cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.\n\nHow many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?\n\nTwo. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon's house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen's mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation. The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin's hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen's father and Stephen's granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.\n\nDid Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?\n\nVery gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.\n\nDid their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them?\n\nMrs Riordan, a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen's parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O'Dowd of 54 Prussia street where during parts of the years 1893 and 1894 she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.\n\nHad he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?\n\nHe had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low's place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles, equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and vice versa.\n\nWhy could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?\n\nBecause in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round precipitous globe.\n\nWhat distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?\n\nThe older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositions wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.\n\nWere there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?\n\nThe indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow's Physical Strength and How To Obtain It which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.\n\nHad any special agility been his in earlier youth?\n\nThough ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High School scholar he had excelled in his table and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.\n\nDid either openly allude to their racial difference?\n\nNeither.\n\nWhat, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom's thoughts about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom and Bloom's thoughts about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom's thoughts about Stephen?\n\nHe thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.\n\nWhat, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages?\n\nBloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently Rudolf Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty); Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).\n\nHad Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or layman?\n\nBloom (three times) by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. A. alone in the protestant church of Saint Nicolas Without, Coombe; by James O'Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of Swords; and by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone, C. C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.\n\nDid they find their educational careers similar?\n\nSubstituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame's school and the high school. Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree course of the royal university.\n\nWhy did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?\n\nBecause of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.\n\nWhat two temperaments did they individually represent?\n\nThe scientific. The artistic.\n\nWhat proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?\n\nCertain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.\n\nWere these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?\n\nYes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playingballs, historically costumed dolls.\n\nWhat also stimulated him in his cogitations?\n\nThe financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James, the former by his 1d. bazaar at 42 George's street, South, the latter at his 6 1/2d. shop and world's fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 Henry street, admission 2d., children 1d.; and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to decide.\n\nSuch as?\n\nK. 11.

Nannetti, M. P., Rotunda Ward, 19 Hardwicke street, under the obituary notices and anniversaries of deceases. The name on the label is Plumtree. A plumtree is a meatpot, registered trade mark. Beware of imitations. Peatmot. Trumplee. Montpat. Plamtroo.\n\nWhich example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to success?\n\nHis own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing.\n\nWhat suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?\n\nSolitary hotel in mountain pass. Autumn. Twilight. Fire lit. In dark corner young man seated. Young woman enters. Restless. Solitary. She sits. She goes to window. She stands. She sits. Twilight. She thinks. On solitary hotel paper she writes. She thinks. She writes. She sighs. Wheels and hoofs. She hurries out. He comes from his dark corner. He seizes solitary paper. He holds it towards fire. Twilight. He reads. Solitary\n\nWhat?\n\nIn sloping, upright and backhands: Queen's hotel, Queen's hotel, Queen's Ho...\n\nWhat suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?\n\nThe Queen's Hotel, Ennis, County, Glare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment, composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on the morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17 Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at 3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main street, Ennis.\n\nDid he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition?\n\nCoincidence.\n\nDid he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?\n\nHe preferred himself to see another's face and listen to another's words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved.\n\nDid he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The Parable of the Plums?\n\nIt, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms (e.g. My Favourite Hero or Procrastination is the Thief of Time) composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon's Studies in Blue, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlict, Tuesday, 21 June (S. Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m.\n\nWhich domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind?\n\nWhat to do with our wives.\n\nWhat had been his hypothetical singular solutions?\n\nParlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spillikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.\n\nWhat instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?\n\nIn disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec. She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external. In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid. After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), alias (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred Scripture).\n\nWhat compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?\n\nThe false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction. The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.\n\nHow had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?\n\nVariously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other's ignorant lapse.\n\nWith what success had he attempted direct instruction?\n\nShe followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest, comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error.\n\nWhat system had proved more effective?\n\nIndirect suggestion implicating self-interest.\n\nExample?\n\nShe disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.\n\nAccepting the analogy implied in his guest's parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce?\n\nThree seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of More Neubkim (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).\n\nWhat statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen?\n\nThat the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain.\n\nWere other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned?\n\nFelix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher), Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).\n\nWhat fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest?\n\nBy Stephen: suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus, suil go cuin (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).\n\nBy Bloom: Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m'baad l'zamatejch (thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).\n\nHow was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison?\n\nOn the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entitled Sweets of Sin (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted goph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1,4 and 100.\n\nWas the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?\n\nTheoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.\n\nWhat points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them?\n\nThe presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homilectic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara) Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S. Mary's Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve's tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and Jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanan David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.\n\nWhat anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple, ethnically irreductible consummation?\n\nKolod balejwaw pnimali\nNefesch, jehudi, homijah.\n\nWhy was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?\n\nIn consequence of defective mnemotechnic.\n\nHow did the chanter compensate for this deficiency? By a periphrastic version of the general text.\n\nIn what common study did their mutual reflections merge?\n\nThe increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).\n\nDid the guest comply with his host's request?\n\nDoubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.\n\nWhat was Stephen's auditive sensation?\n\nHe heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past.\n\nWhat was Bloom's visual sensation?\n\nHe saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future.\n\nWhat were Stephen's and Bloom's quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities?\n\nVisually, Stephen's: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.\n\nAuditively, Bloom's: The traditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe.\n\nWhat future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what exemplars?\n\nIn the church, Roman, Anglican, or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very reverend John Conmee S.J., the reverend T. Salmon, D.D., provost of Trinity college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. At the bar, English or Irish: exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K.C., Rufus Isaacs, K.C. On the stage, modern or Shakespearean exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle (1901), exponent of Shakespeare.\n\nDid the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme?\n\nReassuringly, their place where none could hear them talk being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed.\n\nRecite the first (major) part of this chanted legend?\n\nD Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for to play ball\nAnd the very first ball little Harry Hughes played\nHe drove it o'er the jew's garden wall.\nAnd the very second ball little Harry Hughes played\nHe broke the jew's windows all.\n\nHow did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?\n\nWith unmixed feeling. Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window.\n\nRecite the second part (minor) of the legend.\n\nThen out there came the jew's daughter\nAnd she all dressed in green.\n`Come back, come back, you pretty little boy,\nAnd play your ball again.'\n\n`I can't come back and I won't come back\nWithout my schoolfellows all,\nFor if my master he did hear\nHe'd make it a sorry ball.'\n\nShe took him by the lilywhite hand\nAnd led him along the hall\nUntil she led him to a room\nWhere none could hear him call.\n\nShe took a penknife out of her pocket\nAnd cut off his little head,\nAnd now he'll play his ball no more\nFor he lies among the dead.\n\nHow did the father of Millicent receive this second part?\n\nWith mixed feelings. Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew's daughter, all dressed in green.\n\nCondense Stephen's commentary.\nOne of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by inadvertence, twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.\n\nWhy was the host (victim predestined) sad?\n\nHe wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.\n\nWhy was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?\n\nIn accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.\n\nWhy was the host (secret infidel) silent?\n\nHe weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitation of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.\n\nFrom which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?\n\nFrom hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated in night attire had lain, sleeping.\n\nHad this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?\n\nTwice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.\n\nWhat other infantile memories had he of her?\n\n15 June 1889. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.\n\nWhat endemic characteristics were present?\n\nConversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to its most distant intervals.\n\nWhat memories had he of her adolescence?\n\nShe relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke's lawn entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated). On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the 15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated).\n\nDid that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?\n\nLess than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.\n\nWhat second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly if differently?\n\nA temporary departure of his cat.\n\nWhy similarly, why differently?\n\nSimilarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male (Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.\n\nIn other respects were their differences similar?\n\nIn passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.\n\nAs?\n\nInasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf. neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen's green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf. mousewatching cat). Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf. earwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf. hearthdreaming cat). Hence in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.\n\nIn what way had he utilised gifts 1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?\n\nAs object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions clockwise of movable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour, when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, videlicet, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.\n\nIn what manners did she reciprocate?\n\nShe remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation crown Derby porcelain ware. She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires. She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him not for her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.\n\nWhat proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?\n\nTo pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess.\n\nWhat various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such extemporisation?\n\nFor the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.\n\nWhy might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew's daughter?\n\nBecause the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter.\n\nTo what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer?\n\nIf he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.\n\nWhat inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host?\n\nA statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of Mrs Mary Dedalus, born Goulding, 26 June 1903, vigil of the anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).\n\nWas the proposal of asylum accepted?\n\nPromptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.\n\nWhat exchange of money took place between host and guest?\n\nThe former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (\u01531.7s.0.), one pound seven shillings, advanced by the latter to the former.\n\nWhat counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?\n\nTo inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the Ship hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W. and E. Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places).\n\nWhat rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?\n\nThe irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler's circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown's) papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2s.) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J. and T. Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.\n\nWas the clown Bloom's son?\n\nNo.\n\nHad Bloom's coin returned?\n\nNever.\n\nWhy would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?\n\nBecause at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity.\n\nHe believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?\n\nThere remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis from infancy through maturity to decay.\n\nWhy did he desist from speculation?\n\nBecause it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.\n\nDid Stephen participate in his dejection?\n\nHe affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro- and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void.\n\nWas this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?\n\nNot verbally. Substantially.\n\nWhat comforted his misapprehension?\n\nThat as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.\n\nI n what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?\n\nLighted Candle in Stick borne by\nBLOOM.\nDiaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by\nSTEPHEN.\n\nWith what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm?\n\nThe 113th, modus peregrinus: In exitu Isra\u00ebl de Egypto: domus Jacob de populo barbaro.\n\nWhat did each do at the door of egress?\n\nBloom set the candlestick on the floor. Stephen put the hat on his head.\n\nFor what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?\n\nFor a cat.\n\nWhat spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?\n\nThe heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.\n\nWith what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?\n\nMeditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipent lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Major) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.\n\nWere there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?\n\nOf the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.\n\nWhy did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?\n\nBecause some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.\n\nDid he find the problem of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?\n\nOf a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated, from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and all that is vanity.\n\nAnd the problem of possible redemption?\nThe minor was proved by the major.\n\nWhich various features of the constellations were in turn considered?\n\nThe various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions: the waggoner's star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, 10 August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar origin but lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.\n\nHis (Bloom's) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error?\n\nThat it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity, renderable equally finite by the suppositions probable apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its future spectators had entered actual present existence.\n\nWas he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?\n\nIndubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.\n\nDid he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?\n\nIt seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.\n\nWhat special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?\n\nHer antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising, and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.\n\nWhat visible luminous sign attracted Bloom's, who attracted Stephen's gaze?\n\nIn the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom's) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O'Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.\n\nHow did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?\n\nWith indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion.\n\nBoth then were silent?\n\nSilent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.\n\nWere they indefinitely inactive?\n\nAt Stephen's suggestion, at Bloom's instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom's, then Stephen's, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.\n\nSimilarly?\n\nThe trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom's longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter who in his ultimate year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210 scholars: Stephen's higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.\n\nWhat different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?\n\nTo Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pelosity. To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (1st January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.\n\nWhat celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?\n\nA star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.\n\nHow did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?\n\nBy inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.\n\nHow did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?\n\nStanding perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.\n\nWhat sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?\n\nThe sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George.\n\nWhat echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?\n\nBy Stephen:\n\nLiliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet.\nIubilantium te virginum. Chorus excipiat.\n\nBy Bloom:\n\nHeigho, heigho,\nHeigho, heigho.\n\nWhere were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north?\n\nMartin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).\n\nAlone, what did Bloom hear?\n\nThe double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew's harp in the resonant lane.\n\nAlone, what did Bloom feel?\n\nThe cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or R\u00e9aumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn.\n\nOf what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him?\n\nOf companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F. Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordi? hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).\n\nWhat prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?\n\nThe disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of day-break, the apparition of a new solar disk.\n\nHad he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?\n\nOnce, in 1887 after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.\n\nHe remembered the initial paraphenomena?\n\nMore active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.\n\nDid he remain?\n\nWith deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered.\n\nWhat suddenly arrested his ingress?\n\nThe right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.\n\nDescribe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furnitures?\n\nA sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.\n\nDescribe them.\n\nOne: a squat stuffed easychair with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration. The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.\n\nWhat significances attached to these two chairs?\n\nSignificances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.\n\nWhat occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?\n\nA vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies' gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of Love's Old Sweet Song (words by G. Clifton Bingham, composed by J. L. Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications ad libitum, forte, pedal, animato, sustained, pedal, ritirando, close.\n\nWith what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?\n\nWith strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focusing his gaze on a large dull passive and slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan's scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.\n\nHis next proceeding?\n\nFrom an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.\n\nWhat followed this operation?\n\nThat truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.\n\nWhat homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?\n\nA timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46 a.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper.\n\nWhat interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?\n\nIn the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.\n\nWhat composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?\n\nThe image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.\n\nWhy solitary (ipsorelative)?\n\nBrothers and sisters had he none,\nYet that man's father was his grandfather's son.\n\nWhy mutable (aliorelative)?\n\nFrom infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix. From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal creator.\n\nWhat final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?\n\nThe optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite.\n\nCatalogue these books.\n\nThorn's Dublin Post Office Directory, 1886.\n\nDenis Florence M'Carthy's Poetical Works (copper beechleaf bookmark at p. 5).\n\nShakespeare's Works (dark crimson morocco, goldtooled).\n\nThe Useful Ready Reckoner (brown cloth).\n\nThe Secret History of the Court of Charles II (red cloth, tooled binding).\n\nThe Child's Guide (blue cloth).\n\nWhen We Were Boys by William O'Brien M.P.

A. Wren, 9 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nWhat caused him irritation in his sitting posture?\n\nInhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion.\n\nHow was the irritation allayed?\n\nHe removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hair extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebr?, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of the mammary prominences. He unbraced successively each of six minus one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one incomplete.\n\nWhat involuntary actions followed?\n\nHe compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee. He scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly abluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1 shilling), placed there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903) of the interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.\n\nCompile the budget for 16 June 1904.\n\n#. s. d. #. s. d.\n\n1 Pork kidney 0. 0. 3 Cash in hand 0.4.9\n\n2 Copy Freeman's Journal 0.0.2 Commission recd.

continue?\n\nSensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then with satisfaction threw away the lacerated unguinal fragment.\n\nWhy with satisfaction?\n\nBecause the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other unguinal fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs Ellis's juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation.\n\nIn what ultimate ambition had all concurrent and consecutive ambitions now coalesced?\n\nNot to inherit by right of primogeniture, gavelkind or borough English, or possess in perpetuity an extensive demesne of a sufficient number of acres, roods and perches, statute land measure (valuation #42), of grazing turbary surrounding a baronial hall with gatelodge and carriage drive nor, on the other hand, a terracehouse or semidetached villa, described as Rus in Urbe or Qui si Sana, but to purchase by private treaty in fee simple a thatched bungalowshaped 2 storey dwellinghouse of southerly aspect, surmounted by vane and lightning conductor, connected with the earth, with porch covered by parasitic plants (ivy or Virginia creeper), halldoor, olive green, with smart carriage finish and neat doorbrasses, stucco front with gilt tracery at eaves and gable, rising, if possible, upon a gentle eminence with agreeable prospect from balcony with stone pillar parapet over unoccupied and unoccupyable interjacent pastures and standing in 5 or 6 acres of its own ground, at such a distance from the nearest public thoroughfare as to render its houselights visible at night above and through a quickset hornbeam hedge of topiary cutting, situate at a given point not less than 1 statute mile from the periphery of the metropolis, within a time limit of not more than 5 minutes from tram or train line (e.g., Dundrum, south, or Sutton, north, both localities equally reported by trial to resemble the terrestrial poles in being favourable climates for phthisical subjects), the premises to be held under feefarmgrant, lease 999 years, the message to consist of 1 drawingroom with baywindow (2 lancets), thermometer affixed, 1 sittingroom, 4 bedrooms, 2 servants

servant's apartments with separate sanitary and hygienic necessaries for cook, general and betweenmaid (salary, rising by biennial unearned increments of #2, with comprehensive fidelity insurance annual bonus (#1), and retiring allowance (based on the 65 system) after 30 years service), pantry, buttery, larder, refrigerator, outoffices, coal and wood cellarage with winebin (still and sparkling vintages) for distinguished guests, if entertained to dinner (evening dress), carbon monoxide gas supply throughout.\n\nWhat additional attractions might the grounds contain?\n\nAs addenda, a tennis and fives court, a shrubbery, a glass summerhouse with tropical palms, equipped in the best botanical manner a rockery with waterspray, a beehive arranged on humane principles, oval flowerbeds in rectangular grassplots set with eccentric ellipses of scarlet and chrome tulips, blue scillas, crocuses, polyanthus, sweet William, sweat pea, lily of the valley (bulbs obtainable from sir James W. Mackey (Limited) (wholesale and retail) seed and bulb merchant and nurseryman, agent for chemical manures, 23 Sackville street, upper), an orchard, kitchen garden and vinery, protected against illegal trespassers by glasstopped mural enclosures, a lumbershed with padlock for various inventoried implements.\n\nAs?\n\nEeltraps, lobsterpots, fishingrods, hatchet, steelyard, grindstone, clodcrusher, swatheturner, carriagesack, telescope ladder, 10 tooth rake, washing clogs, haytedder, tumbling rake, billhook, paintpot, brush, hoe and so on.\n\nWhat improvements might be subsequently introduced?\n\nA rabbitry and fowlrun, a dovecote, a botanical conservatory, 2 hammocks (lady's and gentleman's), a sundial shaded and sheltered by laburnum or lilac trees, an exotically harmonically accorded Japanese tinkle gatebell affixed to left lateral gatepost, a capacious waterbutt, a lawnmower with side delivery and grassbox, a lawnsprinkler with hydraulic hose.\n\nWhat facilities of transit were desirable?\n\nWhen citybound frequent connection by train or tram from their respective intermediate station or terminal. When countrybound velocipedes, a chainless freewheel roadster cycle with side basketcar attached, or draught conveyance, a donkey with wicker trap or smart phaeton with good working solidungular cob (roan gelding, 14h).\n\nWhat might be the name of this erigible or erected residence?\n\nBloom Cottage. Saint Leopold's. Flowerville.\n\nCould Bloom of 7 Eccles street foresee Bloom of Flowerville?\n\nIn loose allwool garments with Harris tweed cap, price 8/6, and useful garden boots with elastic gussets and wateringcan, planting aligned young firtrees, syringing, pruning, staking, sowing hayseed, trundling a weedladen wheelbarrow without excessive fatigue at sunset amid the scent of newmown hay, ameliorating the soil, multiplying wisdom, achieving longevity.\n\nWhat syllabus of intellectual pursuits was simultaneously possible?\n\nSnapshot photography, comparative study of religions, folklore relative to various amatory and superstitious practices, contemplation of the celestial constellations.\n\nWhat lighter recreations?\n\nOutdoor: garden and fieldwork, cycling on level macadamised causeways, ascents of moderately high hills, natation in secluded fresh water and unmolested river boating in secure wherry or light curricle with kedge anchor on reaches free from weirs and rapids (period of estivation), vespertinal perambulation or equestrian circumprocession with inspection of sterile landscape and contrastingly agreeable cottagers' fires of smoking peat turves (period of hibernation). Indoor discussion in tepid security of unsolved historical and criminal problems: lecture of unexpurgated exotic erotic masterpieces: house carpentry with toolbox containing hammer, awl, nails, screws, tintacks, gimlet, tweezers, bullnose plane and turnscrew.\n\nMight he become a gentleman farmer of field produce and live stock?\n\nNot impossibly, with 1 or 2 stripper cows, 1 pike of upland hay and requisite farming implements, e.g., an end-to-end churn, a turnip pulper etc.\n\nWhat would be his civic functions and social status among the county families and landed gentry?\n\nArranged successively in ascending powers of hierarchical order, that of gardener, groundsman, cultivator, breeder, and at the zenith of his career, resident magistrate or justice of the peace with a family crest and coat of arms and appropriate classical motto (Semper paratus), duly recorded in the court directory (Bloom, Leopold P., M. P., P. C., K. P., L. L. D. honoris cause, Bloomville, Dundrum) and mentioned in court and fashionable intelligence (Mr and Mrs Leopold Bloom have left Kingstown for England).\n\nWhat course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?\n\nA course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes, incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social inequality of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered with mitigants of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the uttermost farthing with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to the crown. Loyal to the highest constituted power in the land, actuated by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order, the repression of many abuses though not of all simultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution), the upholding of the letter of the law (common, statute and law merchant) against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations, all resuscitators (by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings) of venville rights, obsolete by desuetude, all orotund instigators of international persecution, all perpetuators of international animosities, all menial molestors of domestic conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality.\n\nProve that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth.\n\nTo master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his disbelief in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his father Rudolf Virag, later Rudolph Bloom, had been converted from the Israelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting Christianity among the Jews) subsequently abjured by him in favour of Roman catholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony in 1888. To Daniel Magrane and Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile friendship (terminated by the premature emigration of the former) he had advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of colonial (e.g. Canadian) expansion and the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin, expounded in The Descent of Man and The Origin of Species. In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the collective and national economic programme advocated by James Fintan Lalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel, J. F. X.

As a philosopher he knew that at the termination of any allotted life only an infinitesimal part of any person's desires has been realised.

C.).\n\nWhat pleasant reflection accompanied this action?\n\nThe reflection that, apart from the letter in question, his magnetic face, form and address had been favourably received during the course of the preceding day by a wife (Mrs Josephine Breen, born Josie Powell); a nurse, Miss Calian (Christian name unknown), a maid, Gertrude (Gerty, family name unknown).\n\nWhat possibility suggested itself?\n\nThe possibility of exercising virile power of fascination in the most immediate future after an expensive repast in a private apartment in the company of an elegant courtesan, of corporal beauty, moderately mercenary, variously instructed, a lady by origin.\n\nWhat did the 2nd drawer contain?\n\nDocuments: the birth certificate of Leopold Paula Bloom: an endowment assurance policy of #500 in the Scottish Widows' Assurance Society intestated Millicent (Milly) Bloom, coming into force at 25 years as with profit policy of #430, #462--10--0 and #500 at 60 years or death, 65 years or death and death, respectively, or with profit policy (paidup) of #299--10--0 together with cash payment of #133--10--0, at option: a bank passbook issued by the Ulster Bank, College Green branch showing statement of a/c for half year ending 31 December 1903, balance in depositor's favour: #18--14--6 (eighteen pounds, fourteen shillings and six pence, sterling), net personalty: certificate of possession of #900 Canadian 4% (inscribed) government stock (free of stamp duty): dockets of the Catholic Cemeteries' (Glasnevin) Committee, relative to a graveplot purchased: a local press cutting concerning change of name by deedpoll.\n\nQuote the textual terms of this notice.\n\nI, Rudolph Virag, now resident at no 52 Clanbrassil street, Dublin, formerly of Szombathely in the kingdom of Hungary, hereby give notice that I have assumed and intend henceforth upon all occasions and at all times to be known by the name of Rudolph Bloom.\n\nWhat other objects relative to Rudolph Bloom (born Virag) were in the 2nd drawer?\n\nAn indistinct daguerreotype of Rudolph Virag and his father Leopold Virag executed in the year 1852 in the portrait atelier of their (respectively) 1st and 2nd cousin, Stefan Virag of Szesfehervar, Hungary. An ancient hagadah book in which a pair of hornrimmed convex spectacles inserted marked the passage of thanksgiving in the ritual prayers for Pessach (Passover): a photocard of the Queen's Hotel, Ennis, proprietor, Rudolph Bloom: an envelope addressed To my Dear Son Leopold.\n\nWhat fractions of phrases did the lecture of those five whole words evoke?\n\nTomorrow will be a week that I received... it is no use Leopold to be... with your dear mother... that is not more to stand... to her... all for me is out... be kind to Athos, Leopold... my dear son... always... of me... das Herr... Gott... dein...\n\nWhat reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive melancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?\n\nAn old man widower, unkempt hair, in bed, with head covered, sighing: an infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses of grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the face in death of a septuagenarian suicide by poison.\n\nWhy did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?\n\nBecause in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices.\n\nAs?\n\nThe prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal, the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the tetragrammaron: the sanctity of the sabbath.\n\nHow did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?\n\nNot more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared.\n\nWhat first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?\n\nRudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely, with statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresa, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves). Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.\n\nHad time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?\n\nIn narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.\n\nWhat idiosyncrasies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia?\n\nOccasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat. Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an inclined plate. Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper.\n\nWhat two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?\n\nThe myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion.\n\nWhat object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?\n\nThe endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip.\n\nReduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.\n\nSuccessively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and doubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector. Mendicancy: that of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1s. 4d. in the #, sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant, insinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, superannuated bailiff's man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded perforated umbrella. Destitution: the inmate of Old Man's House (Royal Hospital), Kilmainham, the inmate of Simpson's Hospital for reduced but respectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight. Nadir of misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic pauper.\n\nWith which attendant indignities?\n\nThe unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing or less than nothing.\n\nBy what could such a situation be precluded?\n\nBy decease (change of state), by departure (change of place).\n\nWhich preferably?\n\nThe latter, by the line of least resistance.\n\nWhat considerations rendered it not entirely undesirable?\n\nConstant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects. The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. The necessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest.\n\nWhat considerations rendered it not irrational?\n\nThe parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if now disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication, which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties, which was impossible.\n\nWhat considerations rendered it desirable?\n\nThe attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad, as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and hachures.\n\nIn Ireland?\n\nThe cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with submerged petrified city, the Giant's Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle, the Golden Vale of Tipperary, the islands of Aran, the pastures of royal Meath, Brigid's elm in Kildare, the Queen's Island shipyard in Belfast, the Salmon Leap, the lakes of Killarney.\n\nAbroad?\n\nCeylon (with spicegardens supplying tea to Thomas Kernan, agent for Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 2 Mincing lane, London, E. C., 5 Dame street, Dublin), Jerusalem, the holy city (with mosque of Omar and gate of Damascus, goal of aspiration), the straits of Gibraltar (the unique birthplace of Marion Tweedy), the Parthenon (containing statues, nude Grecian divinities), the Wall street money market (which controlled international finance), the Plaza de Toros at La Linea, Spain (where O'Hara of the camerons had slain the bull), Niagara (over which no human being had passed with impunity), the land of the Eskimos (eaters of soap), the forbidden country of Thibet (from which no traveller returns), the bay of Naples (to see which was to die), the Dead Sea.\n\nUnder what guidance, following what signs?\n\nAt sea, septentrional, by night the polestar, located at the point of intersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Major produced and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the rightangled triangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the line alpha delta of Ursa Major. On land, meridional, a bispherical moon, revealed in imperfect varying phases of lunation through the posterior interstice of the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose negligent perambulating female, a pillar of the cloud by day.\n\nWhat public advertisement would divulge the occultation of the departed?\n\n#5 reward lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles street, missing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom, Leopold (Poldy), height 5 ft 9 1/2 inches, full build, olive complexion, may have since grown a beard, when last seen was wearing a black suit. Above sum will be paid for information leading to his discovery.\n\nWhat universal binomial denominations would be his as entity and nonentity?\n\nAssumed by any or known to none. Everyman or Noman.\n\nWhat tributes his?\n\nHonour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman. A nymph immortal, beauty, the bride of Noman.\n\nWould the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?\n\nEver he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events. Somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of recall. Whence, disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or of the silver King.\n\nWhat would render such return irrational?\n\nAn unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible time.\n\nWhat play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?\n\nThe lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares, rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and rendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo, desired desire.\n\nWhat advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an unoccupied bed?\n\nThe removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human (mature female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation of matutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in the case of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the spring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit section).\n\nWhat past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of accumulated fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate?\n\nThe preparation of breakfast (burnt offering): intestinal congestion and premeditative defecation (holy of holies): the bath (rite of John): the funeral (rite of Samuel): the advertisement of Alexander Keyes (Urim and Thummin): the unsubstantial lunch (rite of Melchizedek): the visit to museum and national library (holy place): the bookhunt along Bedford row, Merchants' Arch, Wellington Quay (Simchath Torah): the music in the Ormond Hotel (Shira Shirim): the altercation with a truculent troglodyte in Bernard Kiernan's premises (holocaust): a blank period of time including a cardrive, a visit to a house of mourning, a leavetaking (wilderness): the eroticism produced by feminine exhibitionism (rite of Onan): the prolonged delivery of Mrs Mina Purefoy (heave offering): the visit to the disorderly house of Mrs Bella Cohen, 82 Tyrone street, lower, and subsequent brawl and chance medley in Beaver street (Armageddon): nocturnal perambulation to and from the cabman's shelter, Butt Bridge (atonement).\n\nWhat selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as to conclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?\n\nThe cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by the insentient material of a strainveined timber table.\n\nWhat selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not comprehend?\n\nWho was M'Intosh?\n\nWhat selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30 years did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the extinction of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?\n\nWhere was Moses when the candle went out?\n\nWhat imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, silently, successively, enumerate?\n\nA provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement, to obtain a certain quantity of tea from Thomas Kernan (agent for Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 5 Dame street, Dublin, and 2 Mincing lane, London, E. C.), to certify the presence or absence of posterior rectal orifice in the case of Hellenic female divinities, to obtain admission (gratuitous or paid) to the performance of Leah by Mrs Bandman Palmer at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49, South King street.\n\nWhat impression of an absent face did Bloom, arrested, silently recall?\n\nThe face of her father, the late Major Brian Cooper Tweedy, Royal Dublin Fusiliers, of Gibraltar and Rehoboth, Dolphin's Barn.\n\nWhat recurrent impressions of the same were possible by the hypothesis?\n\nRetreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines meeting at infinity, if produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from infinity, with constant uniform retardation, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, returning.\n\nWhat miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were perceived by him?\n\nA pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies' hose, a pair of new violet garters, a pair of outsize ladies' drawers of India mull, cut on generous lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti's Turkish cigarettes and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded curvilinear, a camisole of baptiste with thin lace border, an accordion underskirt of blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed irregularly on the top of a rectangular trunk, quadruple battened, having capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its fore side in white lettering B. C. T. (Brian Cooper Tweedy).\n\nWhat impersonal objects were perceived?\n\nA commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne cutting, apple design, on which rested a lady's black straw hat. Orangekeyed ware, bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware and ironmongery manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore street, disposed irregularly on the washstand and floor, and consisting of basin, soapdish and brushtray (on the washstand, together), pitcher and night article (on the floor, separate).\n\nBloom's acts?\n\nHe deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.\n\nHow?\n\nWith circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adder: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.\n\nWhat did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?\n\nNew clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.\n\nIf he had smiled why would he have smiled?\n\nTo reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone, whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating In and repeated to infinity.\n\nWhat preceding series?\n\nAssuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d'Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society's Horse Show, Maggot O'Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E. (Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to nolast term.\n\nWhat were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and late occupant of the bed?\n\nReflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).\n\nWhy for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?\n\nBecause he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.\n\nWith what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?\n\nEnvy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.\n\nEnvy?\n\nOf a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse.\n\nJealousy?\n\nBecause a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction. Because action between agents and reagents at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance. Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.\n\nAbnegation?\n\nIn virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.\n\nEquanimity?\n\nAs natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity. As not as calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of collision with a dark sun. As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king's enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder. As not more abnormal than all other altered processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease. As more than inevitable, irreparable.\n\nWhy more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?\n\nFrom outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.\n\nWhat retribution, if any?\n\nAssassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by combat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witness), not yet. Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly. If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting separator from both.\n\nBy what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?\n\nThe preordained frangibility of the hymen, the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the self abbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female, the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.\n\nIn what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?\n\nSatisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise) of adipose posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality.\n\nThe visible signs of antesatisfaction?\n\nAn approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative revelation; a silent contemplation.\n\nThen?\n\nHe kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.\n\nThe visible signs of postsatisfaction?\n\nA silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.\n\nWhat followed this silent action?\n\nSomnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation, catechetical interrogation.\n\nWith what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?\n\nNegative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co, Limited, 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty), surname unknown. Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs Bandman Palmer of Leah at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, an invitation to supper at Wynn's (Murphy's) Hotel, 35, 36, and 37 Lower Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical tendency entitled Sweets of Sin, anonymous, author a gentleman of fashion, a temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement in the course of postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since completely recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author, eldest surviving son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an aeronautical feat executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a witness, the professor and author aforesaid, with promptitude of decision and gymnastic flexibility.\n\nWas the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWhich event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?\n\nStephen Dedalus, professor and author.\n\nWhat limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?\n\nBy the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8 September 1870), viz. 8 October, and consummated on the same date with female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated on the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last taken place 5 weeks previous, viz. 27 November 1893, to the birth on 29 December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894, aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ. By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.\n\nHow?\n\nBy various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected or effected.\n\nWhat moved visibly above the listener's and the narrator's invisible thoughts?\n\nThe upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.\n\nIn what directions did listener and narrator lie?\n\nListener, S. E. by E.; Narrator, N. W. by W.: on the 53rd parallel of latitude, N. and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45\u00f8 to the terrestrial equator.\n\nIn what state of rest or motion?\n\nAt rest relatively to themselves and to each other. In motion being each and both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by the proper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of neverchanging space.\n\nIn what posture?\n\nListener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right leg extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the attitude of Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed. Narrator: reclined laterally, left, with right and left legs flexed, the indexfinger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose, in the attitude depicted on a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn, the childman weary, the manchild in the womb.\n\nWomb? Weary?\n\nHe rests. He has travelled.\n\nWith?\n\nSinbad the Sailor and Tinbad the Tailor and Jinbad the Jailer and Whinbad the Whaler and Ninbad the Nailer and Finbad the Failer and Binbad the Bailer and Pinbad the Pailer and Minbad the Mailer and Hinbad the Hailer and Rinbad the Railer and Dinbad the Kailer and Vinbad the Quailer and Linbad the Yailer and Xinbad the Phthailer.\n\nWhen?\n\nGoing to a dark bed there was a square round Sinbad the Sailor roc's auk's egg in the night of the bed of all the auks of the rocs of Darkinbad the Brightdayler.\n\nWhere?2Embed",

(what?)\nYour worst dream is that you was gonna hear that\nIcon to rap is like John the Baptist\nPrepared the way for what I came to say today\nThey deceived us, having thinking Jesus\nReally didn't need us, when He loved the old days\nHe loved them boys in the hallway up in Broadway\nEven those who re up for dope, every four days\nTo the strippers in broad day up in Norway\nTo the Detroit player gators in Marbres\nWith me, it's not just bars of music\nI walk with God, I got the scars to prove it\n[Chorus]\n(Jesus walks)\nGod show me the way, now the devil can't break me down\n(Jesus walks with me)\nThe only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now\n\n[Outro: Mase]\nEverybody out there\nJust lift your hands right now\nJust say this with me\nFather, I thank you\nFor forgiving me of everything I've ever done\nFor Jesus walking with me\nFor dying for me\nRaising for me\nAnd all my sins have been forgiven\nI'm a changed man\nI'm healed, I'm delivered, I'm rich\nAnd it's all because of Him\nNow walk with me\nWalk with me, walk, walk, walk with me\nWalk with me5Embed",

        "text": "11 ContributorsKanye West: A Brand-New Ye LyricsKanye West has been married for ten days, and he has that new-husband way with the ring still, pulling it on and off like it's something he might yet undo, or do again. The ring is gold, and understated in a way that not much else about Kanye West is. He sits in the lobby of New York's Mercer Hotel\u2014the same hotel where he and Jay Z recorded most of Watch the Throne\u2014reflecting on the distance he's come. \"I am a black American male from Chicago,\" West says, \"who had my rehearsal dinner at Versailles and then got married in Florence with a view of the entire city.\"\n\nHe is one year removed from Yeezus, the record that took all of West's prodigious pop gifts and made a show of immolating them one by one. He is one year removed from telling anyone who'd listen that he was going to burn the entire fashion industry down, or at least he would once they let him through the door. Now they kind of have: He's got a capsule collection with A.P.C. out now; a line with Adidas that debuts with footwear this fall; and somewhere off in the distance, a new menswear line. He's also got a new record\u2014maybe even a full-on pop record, though he hasn't decided yet. He knows he is no longer the most popular man in rap. \"Currently that spot is taken,\" West says. \"Let's be honest\u2014he got last summer.\"\n\nWho?\n\n\"You know. There's only one person.\"\n\nDrake?\n\n\"Yeah. He got last summer. And I'd never given it up till last summer.\" Now he's thinking about taking it back. \"It's a real question for me. Do I want to?\"\n\nMeanwhile, he's reckoning with what it is to be a father and a husband and a decent human. He's happier now\u2014\"You see I haven't name-dropped and said a bunch of negative stuff about people,\" he says at one point\u2014but no less homicidally competitive or less convinced that he's the next Steve Jobs. He'd like to spend more time with his family. He'd also still like to build amusement parks. It's a contradiction, one he's only begun to resolve. And all the while, he can't go outside with his wife, Kim Kardashian, without having his photo taken. His entire waking life has become a performance, a manifesto, a fashion shoot\n\nMost of the time, he's cool with that fact. But not always. \"I hope we don't see no paparazzi today,\" West says. \"Because I'm still getting acquainted with these jogging pants I threw on. Like, 'That's not my statement!'\t\"\n\nYou got married a week ago. You're the lead subject in practically every tabloid on the planet right now. Are you comfortable in that position, having that many eyes on you?\nThat wasn't my goal. My goal is just to be respected as a man when I walk down the street with my family. I don't care what your job is, you're not gonna talk down to me, you're not gonna try to get a rise out of me. I'm a man first. And in establishing that, some interesting things have happened. [laughs]\nLike that TMZ video from last year, where you're walking with your pregnant fianc\u00e9e with your head down to avoid the paparazzi, to the point where you walked into a sign and hit your head. Then TMZ made fun of you for walking into the sign. How do you live like that?\nIt's difficult. And then put on top of that the idea of going and taking meetings with people, and people say, \"We don't want to work with you, because we saw you get mad about running into the sign.\"\n\nDoes that kind of mockery feel like an effort to de-fang you?\nBut also, there's no fangs. I don't have fangs. I'm a porcupine. I'm a blowfish. Like, I'm a\u2014what's the fish that blows up?\n\nA blowfish?\nYeah. I'm a blowfish. I'm not a shark, I'm a blowfish. So that perfect example about me hitting my head, it's like a blowfish. I wasn't coming out of my house going to a paparazzi's house to attack them. I'm defending my family in front of my own house. I'm defending my name as someone's screaming something negative at me. That's a blowfish. People have me pinned as a shark or a predator in some way, and in no way am I that. I wouldn't want to hurt anyone. I want to defend people. I want to help people\nCan I read you something? The New York Post's Page Six has an account of your wedding that reads, in part: \"Kanye returned one hour before the wedding and didn't like the all-white bar that was in front of the Gold Toilet Tower. He took a saw and started sawing it in half himself. Two men held the bar stable as he sawed, and sawed, into the bar, defacing the entire front, screaming at everyone around him. He said it looked like a bar from Texas. Then he ordered two pieces of raw wood to be nailed onto the front of the bar. Once the wood was in place, 'Now,' he said, 'it's art.' The Italian construction teams looked at this guy and couldn't believe what they were seeing.\"\nFor the person that wrote that, were they involved with anything last year that was as culturally significant as the Yeezus tour or that album? They didn't even talk there about the photographs, or the dress, or Andrea Bocelli singing, or the marble tables. They're like: \"It's a gold toilet.\" No. The bathrooms\u2014that usually would be a porta-potty\u2014were wrapped in a fabric that was neutral to match the fort. The bar was terrible, and the wedding planner didn't approve it with me. I was having issues with this wedding planner the entire time on approvals, and I get there and they threw some weird plastic bar there. So the same materials that were used to cover the bathroom, we said, \"Let's just use that, because this is all we have to make the bar look better.\" Which it did, in the end. And anyone knows that you cannot pick up tools yourself, because of\u2014what are those rules about the workers?\n\nUnions?\nYeah, unions. You can't do that. It's illegal. That's false\n\nThen they say you gave a forty-five-minute toast to yourself\nAnd what I talked about in it was the idea of celebrity, and celebrities being treated like blacks were in the '60s, having no rights, and the fact that people can slander your name. I said that in the toast. And I had to say this in a position where I, from the art world, am marrying Kim. And how we're going to fight to raise the respect level for celebrities so that my daughter can live a more normal life. She didn't choose to be a celebrity. But she is. So I'm going to fight to make sure she has a better life\n\nHow does it feel when you read something like that account of your wedding or you see a photo of you looking glum at a zipline go viral?\nMy feelings don't matter anymore\n\nOf course they do\nNo. One of the things that I said at the speech was, anyone that's at this table has had to defend me or Kim or both of us at some point in their life. Ask a boxer: \"In the third round, when he hit you from the side on your ear, how did that specifically feel?\" You wouldn't ask a boxer that. Because you know they're there to fight. Meaning now you know I'm here to fight. I'm here to fight for the re-education of what celebrity is. To say, \"Yes, we are celebrities, but yes, we're also innovators, we're also inventors, we're also thoughtful.\"\n\nBut that's sad to me. You should be able to be a human with feelings, too\nThat's fine. But that's not the case, is it?\n\nIs that the way you feel, that you're always in the ring?\nYeah. I'm sitting right here, it's a fight. I'm fighting with the way I line my words up together and the way I place a sweater on top of a T-shirt. At this point, people know what's up. People know I'm smart. And people know that, whether it's SNL or Jimmy Kimmel, it's a trend to take the piss out of celebrity\u2014just as much of a trend as wearing a gray hoodie or driving a Prius\n\nBut you voluntarily married into a celebrity family, right? In 2014, there are no bigger tabloid stars than Kim Kardashian\nIn the speech, I talked about the idea of collaboration and all the people involved working together and being able to change things. Meaning there was a time for two or three years where fashion designers wouldn't give Kim dresses. There was a time they wouldn't even let me be at shows. Now the idea that Kim is in a Givenchy Couture dress is raising the communication. Because people would be more apt to be like, \"Celebrities don't really have style. Celebrities can't dress. Celebrities are less educated.\" But they haven't had the chance to be able to break through and have Carine Roitfeld sitting right there. Carine Roitfeld is the Walt Disney of what Tumblr is today. She is the Kanye West of what Tumblr is today. She's the single most important person to what street style is today. And she was at the wedding seven seats down from Kim, who is one of the number one fashion plates of today. So I said, \"Wow, Carine is seven seats down from Kim. Farnaz [Farjam], the producer of the Kardashians and the producer of The Real World, is four seats down from [director] Steve McQueen. And four seats, because in between them is Hosain [Rahman] from Jawbone.\" This is what I talked about. That was not a forty-five-minute speech to myself. Do you realize what that means for those people to be in that close of a proximity to each other?\n\nBut if you read a lot of the tabloid coverage, the implication is: Kim and her family are bringing you down. Jay Z and Beyonc\u00e9 didn't show up at your wedding because of them. That kind of thing\nAll that, I wouldn't even speak on. It doesn't even matter to me whatsoever, who would show up. Because the most important person to show up there, to me, was Kim. And that's all that matters to me. I had to fight for that for seven years. But the fact that these other people showed up that are from such different worlds but have done such dynamic things\u2014they're all, in a way, equal to what Kim has done in TV or what I had done in music. I was so moved that I just wanted people to stop and think they weren't sitting at a table full of fashion people, they weren't sitting at a table full of celebrities, they weren't sitting at a table full of movie directors. It really was a representation of the way we receive information today, post-Internet. And so Page Six can't overshadow the main point: Carine Roitfeld was sitting next to Kim Kardashian. That alone to me is like the same moment when I brought Mos Def to the studio with Jay Z. It's about the people, and the fact that they're from different walks of life, and that they're working together and not discriminating against each other. There was a class system, and now there's a creative class system, and I think that's what you were talking about a bit\u2014the class system of creativity\nAnd my point was, they leave Kim out of it\nAnd my point is, they were all at her wedding\n\nA skeptic would say that's because of you\nBut when an Instagram photo gets 2.3 million likes\u2014\n\nYour wedding photo, which is currently the most liked photo on Instagram ever.\nThat's because of who?\n\nI don't know\nDon't say you don't know! It's because of Kim. Meaning there's no photo that I would have put up by myself, or next to one of my smarty friends, that would have got that amount of likes. So now you take this photo that has that amount of likes, and it has a flower wall from the same guy who does the Lanvin shows, and it has a couture Givenchy dress and Givenchy tuxedo in it. That's the point. Now the thing that is the most popular is also communicating the highest level of creativity. The concept of Kimye has more cultural significance than what Page Six could write\n\nWhy'd you decide to get married?\nSaying \"Hey, I like Kim\" isn't as inspiring to people as us getting married. And anyone that's in a relationship knows that in order to get to the point to get married and then to be married and to then carry on, it needs that work put into it. Right now, people look at it and it's like, \"Wow, that's inspiring.\" Meaning that love is infectious. You know, God is infectious\u2014God flowing through us and us being little-baby creators and shit. But His energy and His love and what He wants us to have as people and the way He wants us to love each other, that is infectious. Like they said in Step Brothers: Never lose your dinosaur. This is the ultimate example of a person never losing his dinosaur. Meaning that even as I grew in cultural awareness and respect and was put higher in the class system in some way for being this musician, I never lost my dinosaur\n\nKim is this girl who fucking turns me on. I love her. This is who I want to be next to and be around. And then people would try to say, \"Well, you know, if you're a musician, you should be with a musician, and if you want to design, you need to be with a girl from the design world.\" I don't give a fuck about people's opinions. Because when a kid falls in love with an airplane or a bike or a dinosaur\u2014especially if you're an only child and it's not because of the book that the sibling was reading\u2014it's like, fuck, you mean to tell me that the dinosaurs walked the earth and stuff like that?! That's amazing! You mean to tell me that these giant multi-ton crafts can fly that fast and that loud, and they can flip, and there's danger, the possibility of them exploding? That's fucking cool! You mean to tell me that this girl with this fucking body and this face is also into style, and she's a nice person, and she has her own money and is family-oriented? That's just as cool as a fucking fighter jet or dinosaur! And just as rarely seen\n\nThat's a lovely way of putting it\nI feel like you're stronger as a team. Because when you know you have a team player, it's not one on the world anymore. At least it's two on the world\n\nTwo and a half, if you want to count your daughter\nYeah, and then two and a half, eventually. It's like having some eyes in the back of your head. That's one reason why, when people try to spoof or talk shit, it's like: But you're mad because basically Kim is the type of girl that, her entire life, if you were in school with her, most people would be studying and up late nights, but for some reason she would have the skill set to go and grab the one book, turn to the exact page, and just magically say, \"That's the exact answer.\" Or she could wink at the person who had done all the work and get it done anyway. And the point of life is getting shit done and being happy\n\nAre you the father you hoped you'd be? There's that song on Watch the Throne, \"New Day,\" where you and Jay Z talk about your unborn children, and you basically say: \"I want my kid to be completely the polar opposite of me.\"\nAnd the joke was that I was supposed to say on the song, \"Come on, Jay, you know we're both gonna have daughters.\" And I'm so mad, because you know when I pop that creative-genius shit? If I had had that, that could've been my one moment where I'm like: \"Okay, fuck all the conversation. Look at that. I called that one.\"\nHow do you feel about Yeezus now, a year later?\nI think Yeezus is the beginning of a completely new era of music. It was all new rules. It just broke every rule possible. None of the ideas were popular ideas. Even \"Bound 2,\" when the video came out, I think people's apprehension\u2014I mean, it's the same as any other Kanye West video. You just have colorful bears running around. It was completely morphed and weird and psychedelic and really druggy. I would have just liked to have had more nudity in it. That's the only thing. I just want to do crazy, colorful shit like that that has more nudity\n\nWhat about \"New Slaves\"? Do you think people would react differently to that song if it came out now?\nIt's funny, because when the Clippers situation happened, people started bringing up that song again. Sometimes you do things in the same way that a designer might throw out a new cut or a rapper might throw out a new concept, and people might not be into it at that time. If \"New Slaves\" had come out right after the Clippers incident, it would have seemed more timely. So the thirty meetings that I was having where I was going through a lot of these \"Stay in your place\" type conversations\u2014\"Stay in your box, this is what you do, you can't do anything else\"\u2014that led me to the point of creating \"New Slaves\" and \"Blood on the Leaves\" and the entire Yeezus album, and to make the album basically like a protest in music, where it only has like four melodies on it\u2014you know, other people weren't in that place. Obviously certain things are more digestible for mass consumption. But it was interesting. That song that I do feel is the best rap verse of all\nTime\u2014\n\nWhich song?\n\"New Slaves.\" The second verse. I argue that it's the best rap verse of all time. It's the Coming to America or Anchorman of a verse. You know, it's got the funny shit. It's got the antagonization. It's got patterns. It's got social and political consciousness. It's got struggle. It's got bravado. It's everything that a rap verse is supposed to be\n\nWere you mad when Rick Rubin came out and said that you did half the vocals on Yeezus in two hours before hopping on a plane?\nYeah! Because yeah, I rapped them. But I worked on them for like eight months! And the thing is, I had to finish the verses in order for the album to come out, and it's game time. I didn't freestyle those verses. That shit was worked and processed and Disneyfied and everything. By the way, those lines are super scary and serious, and everything that I'm saying on Yeezus is super politically direct, so I think that it's funny that you said that, because I think he needs to clarify that to people\u2014that I didn't make it up in that time. I just said them in that time\n\nWhen you said what you said last year about the fashion industry and your frustration with it, did your phone ring after that?\nIt did move the needle. Only positive came from it. Maybe I'm not as good friends as I could have been with the Saint Laurent designer. And now I don't get the red-and-black versions of the white-and-black pants that are in stores, or whatever I would have got as a musician. But other than that, that communication was real. Alexander Wang made sure that I was able to go to a Balenciaga show, and I was never allowed to do that before because I was a celebrity. Listen to what I'm saying\u2014me, as Kanye West: I guarantee you, I'm more than 50 percent responsible for every men's shoe that they sell. Me, the singular person. More than 50 percent responsible for every Balenciaga shoe they sell. And they would say, \"You can't come to the show, because you are a celebrity.\" But all honesty, no ego, I have a level of influence, and I have a level of respect for the designers. And we move product on that Barneys floor\n\nThere's an analogy to music, right? You provided the sales template there, too. You can't listen to rap now without hearing music that sounds like your old music, right?\nIt sounds exactly like that\n\nWhat does that mean in terms of putting the new record together? Do you want the pendulum to swing back and do something more pop, like Twisted Fantasy or Graduation?\nI think just my usual pattern is like that. It's like a pendulum. The pendulum gains momentum by swinging in the other direction. Even lyrically, I think about certain lines that I say on my new single, which is called \"All Day,\" that usually Jay would say, but Jay's not on there. So I say, All day, nigga, it's Ye, nigga. Shopping for the winter, it's just May, nigga. Ball so hard, man, this shit cray, nigga. You ain't getting money unless you got eight figures. Right? Jay would have said that. And then eventually I would have came in with, like, whatever I come in with. But the balance of a meal is that when people walk in, they want water first. People definitely weren't getting water first on Yeezus. I do fight with myself to say, \"Keep fighting.\" But also, you know, you can't win every single fight. It's a long war, and if you're out there trying to, like, blow up every single building, you won't win the war\n\nYeezus seemed to be a moment when you maybe let go of wanting a Grammy. You let go of wanting record sales, in a way that seemed uncharacteristic for you\nWhen I was sitting and trying to do a collaboration with the Gap, in the meeting, when they're like, \"No, because you're a celebrity, and you have a bad reputation, and you don't know anything about clothing, so we don't want to do this\"\u2014in that meeting, there's no extra single that I could have done that could have got me that deal. There's no extra Grammy that I could have won that could have made it more real. And that's the reason why I had to express the way I feel. Which all rhymed just right there. But Yeezus was extremely purposeful. And what came from Yeezus: Paparazzi are nicer to me. The entire fashion industry is nicer to me. I do have a collaboration coming out. Young designers that would go and work at a house now look and say, \"Wow, maybe we could potentially work at Donda. Maybe we could work for Kanye. Maybe that's a real thing.\" Because designers that are geared up to only want to work at a French fashion house are completely under the perception that it wouldn't be cool to work for a celebrity\n\nBut it's such a delicate dance, right? At a certain point, maybe you have to go back and you have to sell some records, win some awards, to maintain your spot in music\nMan, it's crazy. And having to take all of your energy, or a lot more of your energy, to focus on fashion. And while you're focusing on that, such-and-such just keeps coming for the spot\n\nAnd I might complain about how hard it is in clothing, but also I think it's great that it's so hard. Because the barrier to entry is really, really, really, really high. And I'm literally trying to do\u2014back when I did Watch the Throne, and the fashion, I think it was just too much for people. It was just too crazy. It was just too crazy to do Watch the Throne, \"Niggas in Paris,\" shoot a surround-vision film in Qatar, show the film in Cannes\u2026\n\nPut a kilt on\nYeah, kilt. Then do two fashion shows with Jourdan Dunn, Joan Smalls, Irina Shayk, have Diddy, Anna Wintour, Riccardo, Kim at the show, and drop the Yeezys? It felt like every single industry that I was trying to tap into looked at every other industry and everyone held hands. It was like, \"Fuck that. No. This is just too crazy.\"\n\nSo what's the lesson you take away from that?\nHistory's gonna be harder to make than I thought\n\nIn 2010 you put out My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, released a new record every Friday, you were on Twitter all the time, you were still blogging at that point\u2026 You lived a whole year in public\nYeah\n\nBut you fell back from that\nBoth me and Kim had to learn how to communicate as a team. These are two LeBrons, you know? Meaning she could do shit that a girlfriend in a relationship could never do. Obviously. And I could do stuff that a guy in a relationship could never do. So if you look at half my tweets back then, they were always, like, funny tweets that I wouldn't be able to say now. It wouldn't be respectful to my relationship. It's interesting, as I'm delving into being married: Like, what is my verbal creative communication? That's another thing I really like about clothing and film\u2014you could still communicate with a film, because it's not you. But when you're a reality star or a rapper, you are the film\n\nThat's been true for you, right? The year 2010 was really just a different kind of movie\nYeah. It was more Wolf of Wall Street.\nYou've said that one of the reasons you did Watch the Throne was that you wanted to learn to communicate in the easy way that Jay Z communicated. Do you feel like that experience helped you at all?\nYes! It's picking up skill sets that give you longevity. That's what I like about Jay. He has longevity. He's still at the top of relevancy from the way he moves, the way he interacts with people, his ability to brush things off of his shoulder and just win at life. He's the poster child of winning. And I think I was the poster child of, like, fighting and winning. But you always saw the fight. And with Jay, you always saw the win\n\nAnother gifted communicator in your life is Kim. Have you learned from her?\nThat's funny that you're saying that. One of the reasons why I think that me and Kim are very powerful together isn't just the concept of celebrity or this mega rap star and this mega-beautiful pop star. It's something I explain to my girl: She is who she is. I am who I am. We have advisers and friends and everything, but those people are who they are and we are who we are. And what I had to learn from Kim is how to take more of her advice and less of other people's advice. There's a lot of Kim K skills that were added. In order to win at life, you need some Kim K skills, period\n\nHow close are you, fashion-line-wise? A year away? Five years away?\nIt depends. I think the people that are in the positions of power are starting to see or recognize that it's more than a celebrity thing, it's more than a music thing, and that there is something there. There's people who do celebrity lines. It's what they do. They've signed up to sit at a different table and to be in a different business than the people who do high-end lines\n\nIt's the difference, presumably, between what you're doing for Adidas and what Pharrell or 2 Chainz are doing for Adidas\nYeah. And you haven't even seen what I'm doing for Adidas!\n\nRight. But\u2014\nYou just know\n\nWhat about the new record? How far away is that?\nI don't know, man. I hope I can get one of these songs out in the next couple of weeks, just to have something up and running. But I think most likely September. I go back and forth. Like, should it be September or should it be October? Should it be November? When Beyonc\u00e9 was working on her last album, she took a while. I was thinking it could somehow come out in June, like Yeezus, and just kill it for the summer. But then I'm like, I have to work on Adidas and be with my child\n\nBut you have a lot of the first single already?\nYeah. This time three years ago, here at the Mercer, working on \"Niggas in Paris,\" at this time in early June, it was apparent it was still not finished. I had the \"married at the mall\" line, we had \"that shit cray,\" Jay had his verse\u2026 Jay finished his verse. He always finishes, and my shit is always kind of open. Like, \"Okay, now I've got the Will Ferrell sample, so I need to say something that finishes the verse. But people have to not know what it means.\" [laughs] So it's like problem-solving to get to the point where you're saying, \"going gorillas.\" It's difficult sometimes\n\nBut now, for the new album, one new thing could change everything. I had an idea of the way I wanted to do the album. And then I got a new song that's so good that the album has to be balanced against it. This song is a song that can be in the club like \"Don't Like\" or \"Niggas in Paris.\" Whereas before I was working on the album and I had these beautiful songs, they were just more songs. They weren't saying, \"Okay, tuck your whole summer in.\" They were just saying, \"Hey, I'm a great musician, I make these beautiful songs, and they have all this meaning, and nobody can make anything that means this much.\"\n\nI feel like people have no idea if you're ever actually happy, or what makes you happy\nWell, when I work on an album, it's fun at certain times. There's some accomplishments, and sometimes there's a bit of frustration. And it's usually like a nine-month process, right? This is a multi-lifetime process that we have now embarked on. Meaning starting now, you're just starting to see a glimmer of what the idea of West will mean. So right now, at this age and with this visibility and with the skill sets that Kim is now giving me, I think I have a good chance of success in building something that has longevity, high integrity, high success rate, and is very fulfilling, not only for me creatively but also in adding fulfillment to people's lives. Adding ease. Adding wonder. Adding magic\n\nBut does happiness arrive at the end of that rainbow? I think people genuinely wonder that\nWell, you build your happy wife, happy life, happy home, all this stuff, right? Everybody that's in a relationship that has ever worked on a home knows one of the most frustrating processes is actually working on the home. So when people would see me last year, two years ago, unhappy, I was in the process of building the home\n\nBut what makes me happy is land, and we're on a boat now. This is Christopher Columbus. This is uncharted waters we're on. We'd be super happy to be on land, and also a little bit like, \"Ah, the journey's over!\" But I feel like, we got the Vogue cover, Steve McQueen won the Oscar, we finally got married\u2026 You know? We have a child. We're a family now. I am an arbiter of taste, and people think that I have the ability to make things cool\u2014or if I'm doing it, it should be cool. And I feel that this stuff's starting to be cool. And that feels good to me. Because I don't like walking around with people thinking I'm doing uncool shit, because there's nothing I'm doing that's uncool. It's all innovative. You just might not understand it yet. But it's cool. Family is super cool. Going home to one girl every night is super cool. Just going home and getting on the floor and playing with your child is super cool. Not wearing a red leather jacket, and just looking like a dad and shit, is like super cool. Having someone that I can call Mom again. That shit is super coolYou might also like25Embed",

        "text": "2 ContributorsTrimalchio from Chicago: Flashing Lights and the Great Kanye in West Egg (excerpt) LyricsThere is an axiom that says all books are about other books. This proposition is supported by the fact that the archetypes found in the earliest of recorded literature continue to (re)appear in contemporary literature. Following the supposition that music lyrics, when read through a literary lens, also fall into the contemporary literature categories it is safe to posit that many of the archetypes of classical literature appear in contemporary music. Further, it can be assumed that there exist many songs, as there exist many poems (and other artworks in other forms), \"about\" classical literature, intentionally or otherwise, that can be used as a tool to make the canonized works more accessible to many students if we open our eyes to the existent possibilities. The popularity (and co-optation in many instances) of hip-hop culture in pop culture places rap music lyrics at the forefront of youthful preoccupation. The storied career of Kanye West places him in great company with moguls such as Jay-Z and Sean Combs not only as a hip-hop tastemaker, but also as a cultural icon with the ability to affect other areas of art and \"everyday\" living. West has been responsible, almost single-handedly, the cultural movements (progressions, even) in hip-hop and popular culture over the span of his career. Arguably one of the more controversial popular culture icons, Kanye West's life and career can provide interesting background and analysis for comparison (and contrasting) to one of literature's most famous characters, Jay Gatsby\n\nAs Gatsby's quest for Daisy represents the American Dream, so can Kanye West's quest (personal and professional) be similarly viewed. West's fascinating life story, highlighted by his debut album, College Dropout, is phenomenal, and set his trajectory to the highest of heights, ultimately garnering 10 Grammy nominations, and winning the Best Rap Album Grammy for \"Jesus Walks.\" Jay Gatsby usually fascinates students even if they don't particularly enjoy or understand F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel. The Great Gatsby is probably one of my favorite works to teach because of the time period--the flourishing of the Arts, The Jazz Age, and The Harlem Renaissance---The Roaring Twenties. The Great Depression plays a part in my love of the era as well, but only to symbolize that all good things come to an end, so to speak, as did the run of Jay Gatsby (and those of his ilk). The version of The Great Gatsby taught at my high school, \"The Authorized Text,\" has a preface written by Matthew J. Bruccoli (1992) that states, regarding The Great Gatsby being \"the great American novel\":If this phrase means anything, it means that the novel is the great work of fiction with defining American thematic qualities and that James Gatz/Jay Gatsby is the great American character. He believes in the American Dream of success (\"the orgastic future\"); he fulfills it; he confuses it with Dais),; he is betrayed by it. The appellation great as applied to Gatsby reverberates with irony. He is truly great by virtue of his capacity to commit himself to his aspirations. (xi)I agree that Jay Gatsby has come to symbolize \"the great American character\" much more than I believe The Great Gatsby to be \"the great American novel,\" but my arrival at this opinion of Gatsby has come slowly; unfolding as a great narrative itself, told by a narrator with a bit of distance from its central subject, yet close enough to be privy to details so intimate as to captivate a reader. Bruccoli (1992) refers to Nick Carraway as \"the partially involved narrator\" (xii). I would say such a storyteller narrates this tale\n\nMuch as some people fall in love with the grand concepts of idealism and romanticism, fueling their love for literature, I am simply in love with the hip-hop love story, which fuels nay love for music. It's become an archetype of its own: A kid, somewhere in the world, hears something said in between a kick and a snare drum that evokes a visceral feeling and, at that moment, is struck by H.E.R.--Hip Hop in its Essence and Real, as described by Common Sense in '94 Common (1994). Every person who professes a love for hip-hop knows the moment, and can recall, in vivid detail, their first meeting, courtship, love affair, and heartbreak[s] due to the relationship. I compare the love for literature and. music because one of nay primary methods of teaching literature has been not only through nay love for music, particularly rap lyrics, but also through ideas, expressions, themes, concepts, and characters in hip-hop culture. In Book of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip Hop, Adam Bradley (2009) makes the case for rap's\nLiterary merits:Between the street life and the good life is a broad expanse of\" human experience. Rap has its screenwriters, making Hollywood blockbusters in rhyme with sharp cuts, vivid characters, and intricate plotlines. It has its investigative reporters and conspiracy theorists, its biographers and memoirists, its True Crime authors and its mystery writers. It even has its comics and its sportswriters, its children's authors and its spiritualists. It is high concept and low brow; it has literary hacks and bona fide masters. It has all of these and more, extending an oral tradition as fundamental to human experience, as ancient and as essential, as most anything we have. (158)Even before I had words to clarify this notion of rap as literature, much of my academic education had been informed by it. I would read a piece of literature and automatically make a connection to it somewhere in the realm of hip-hop culture. Bradley (2009) goes a step further to clarify, \"To tell a Familiar narrative in a new way is the motivating impulse behind a lot of rap storytelling\" (159). As a reader of literature, I always found myself discovering the \"familiar narrative\" while listening to the \"new way\" it's being told through hip-hop. With The Great Gatsby being taught in high schools across the world, and the renewed interest in F. Scott Fitzgerald and his novel because of Baz Luhrmann's 2013 movie adaptation (arguably a Hollywood blockbuster), I've come to see, more and more, Jay Gatsby's life as a possible parallel to Kanye West's\n\nI will venture to say that my students' interest in Kanye West is much like their interest in Jay Gatsby--even if they don't particularly enjoy or understand his musical or lyrical intentions, they are interested in him as a person, as a character in the world of pop culture. I will also state that Kanye West, as an artist has, at some point or another in his storied career, worn all of the writerly hats Adam Bradley describes. He has been the screenwriter (his 2010 song, \"Runaway,\" became a short film collaboration with Hype Williams), the investigative reporter and conspiracy theorist (the 2005 song \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone,\" among others), the biographer and memoirist (the 2007 song \"Big Brother,\" a tribute to Jay-Z and his debut single, \"Through the Wire,\" respectively), True Crime author and mystery author (the 2011 collaboration with Jay-Z, \"Murder to Excellence\" and the 2007 song, \"Homecoming,\" respectively), comic (much of his lyrical content depends on witty, comedic elements) and sportswriter (the 2007 collaboration with Li'l Wayne, \"Barry Bonds\"), and his lyrical and musical content ranges from low brow to high brow, all of which can be argued to be very intentional on the part of the artist\n\nBy way of analogy, this is where I begin my The Great Gatsby lessons with my high school students--with Kanye West. Not only Kanye, but also the world in which he operates that has heralded and hated him, admired and despised him, created and destroyed him. Of course, I would not just give the students Kanye and hip-hop/pop culture as a backdrop and set them loose. There's historical precedent for this comparison that the students should know about. Along with abundant information on the \"Jazz Age,\" I present Langston Hughes's 1926 essay, \"The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain.\" Hughes writes of the plight of\"Negro artists\" creating in America in the 1920s--the Harlem Renaissance and some artists' aspirations to create art that is, somehow, not representative of their race or culture, for instance, a poet--not a Negro poet\" (1). This essay begins a discussion about the \"responsibility\" of artists regarding their lives and their art. I ask, \"Can an artist simply be an artist without any consciousness of race and/or culture?\" and \"If so, are his message and meaning likely to be misinterpreted or misjudged because of the titles we, as students, teachers, appreciators, consumers and critics, place on the artist, whether it's African-American, female, young, old?\" This always leads to an interesting discussion, especially because of the correlation to the same questions being asked about current trends and artists in pop culture. Hughes (1926) sums up his perspective in the closing of his essay:We younger Negro artists who create now intend to express our individual dark-skinned selves without fear or shame. If white people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, it doesn't matter. We know we are beautiful. And ugly too. The tom-tom cries and the tom-tom laughs. If colored people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, their displeasure doesn't matter either. We build our temples for tomorrow, strong as we know how, and we stand on top of the mountain, free within ourselves. (1)Of course, this is only one of many perspectives on the obligation of artists, specifically \"Negro\" artists, but raises the question of \"keeping it real,\" so to speak, and also makes for a perfect connection to the conversation about hip-hop culture, pop culture, and the responsibility of popular artists to be \"good\" representatives of what it means to be black in America. It opens up conversations about mainstream v. underground, the business of music (or art, in general) and artistic integrity\n\nAfter a bit of conversation about the era in which the work was created, I like to discuss the author of the work, to see if the students can gain any valuable information about the work from the life of the person who created it. In his Gatsby introduction, Bruccoli (1992) recalls an F. Scott Fitzgerald quote from 1922, before The Great Gatsby was written, in which he declares, \"I want to write something new--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple + intricately patterned\" (vii). Similarly Kanye West, in an interview with the New York Times's Jon Caramanica (2013), preceding the release of his album Yeezus, heralds it as a project on which Kanye strives for \"aspirational minimalism,\" stating, \"I want to break glass ceilings\" (n.p.). Mr. West's previous solo album is interestingly, in this context, titled My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010). No author, no artist, is so independent of his work that his craft, his brushstrokes, his personality', some degree of his being is not recognizable in the stories he tells. As Fitzgerald wrote Gatsby Kanye writes KANYE. It is a well-known fact that much of what Fitzgerald wrote was inspired by people he'd known (or knew, as is the case with his wife Zelda, and the pages of her diary that inspired some of his stories). As much as they write about the worlds in which they live, both write about themselves. My comparison of Kanye West as a personality--a character--presented in his music and to the music and pop culture-consuming public to Jay Gatsby, therefore, also operates as a comparison of Kanye West as an author and architect to F. Scott Fitzgerald as well. Both men, to varying degrees of achievement, create great American success stories, just as Kanye West's life follows the archetype embodied by Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby\n\nWith the groundwork laid, the discussion of the archetypes can commence. It's at this point that I digress a bit, but only to help illustrate my greater point. I start, as one should, at the beginning of the novel\n\n\"In my younger and more vulnerable years,\" begins the narrator in the opening lines of The Great Gatsby, \"my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since\n\n'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'\"\n\nIn the version of the story I'm always the Nick Carraway character, reserving my judgment, allowing my audience--my students--to come to their own conclusions. I merely state the facts for them:\n\nI met Kanye West in 1999. We both performed at a music festival at Columbia College in Chicago, and I had just killed what was one of the biggest shows of my short \"professional\" rap career. The year leading up to that show 17 had struggled. I had given up an academic scholarship, dropped out of college, lived in my car, and wrote songs I felt represented a struggle that needed to be shared with the masses\n\nI walked offstage, proud, through the crowd of aspiring rappers and IR,&B singers, and greeted him with a compliment, as I assumed many people had in the past (and I'm certain did in the future)\n\nA simple, \"That was dope.\" He returned the compliment\nI told him my name, and as he made a start to tell me who he was, I interjected, \"Oh yeah, I know who you are. You did the tracks on the Infamous Syndicate album. Dope album.\"\n\nI even quoted a few lines fi'om \"What You Do to Me\" to prove I actually was a fan. I gave him a copy of my demo, and we exchanged information. There was a fbllow-up call the next day--he liked two tracks (there were 17 on the tape), and even offered production for an exceptionally reasonable price. I thanked him for the feedback and the offer of a businesslike relationship. I passed on the beats. I prided myself on the fact that I had relationships with producers who worked pro bono, because they liked the rhymes I wrote to their music, and I was the epitome of a struggling artist, so I didn't have the money, even if I wanted to purchase tracks. But I was on my way to stardom and figured our paths would cross again somewhere beyond the atmosphere. My assuredness was only secured by the fact that I had met him--one of my heroes\u00ffon an even playing field. We were doing the same thing. We performed on the same stage\n\nThe next year I would release my album, do more shows, and eventually lose all of that optimistic ambition about nwmyrap career. In that same year Kanye West would go on to become KANYE WEST, tapper/producer extraordinaire, hip-hop/pop culture icon. When his debut album, The College Dropout, dropped in 2004, I was fresh out of school, having finished my Bachelor's degree in English Education and Creative Writing. I was right back where I started, I thought, in those classrooms that helped shape my rap dreams, the same city that fueled those hip-hop ambitions. I became an English teacher because rap didn't work out. I don't think it was because I'm not skilled at it; I just don't think I could commit fully to the idea of venturing outso f:ar with no guarantees and no backup plan\n\nI would continue to write and rap, releasing several music projects, a multimedia novel, and a collection of poetry, stories, and essays. I would eventually come to understand that Mr. West and I were (and possibly still are) flipsides to the same coin. Hip-hop never stopped being my outlet, and I would argue having the experiences that led to my reentry to academia and my career as an educator made me more studious, more industrious, and more driven to \"make it.\" I felt his debut album lampooned what I was doing, and felt it was not only a slight on me and people like me, but also a dangerous message to anyone who listened and thought it might be just that easy to become a celebrity overnight\n\nI've made it my duty to follow West's career, if for no other reason than to remain aware of how he attempts to move hip-hop culture forward, to see what possibly could have been. I am aware of the fact that his career and mine are different roads traveled from that fateful (for are) meeting in 1999. I am also aware of the fact that it has made all the difference in the world that the road he is traveling has informed mine, and in maw ways, mine his. I set out to prove, despite his lampooning, a man could graduate from college, love hip-\nHop, produce, create, excel, and be fulfilled. I imagine that he has spent his career answering to fans like me, the ones who know about the Infamous Syndicate work and the Bad Boy work--the people who were (and still are) fans, and want to know what's next\n\nNot only do I continue writing verses and songs, I have found a bit of contentment in writing about hip-hop. In that way, I like to fancy myself Nick Carraway. Carraway moves from the Midwest to New York to learn the bond business; I wanted to learn the business of hip-hop. Nick meets Jay Gatsby, the epitome of the American Dream successful, flashy, host of the best parties. In my imagination, Jay Gatsby is Kanye West. West has not been able to find peace in the limelight, rather, it seems the more attention he receives, the more he balks at the very idea of \"fame.\" It could be argued that Kanye West, much like F. Scott Fitzgerald's titular character, is somehow standing in a vast wilderness--perhaps pop culture--the darkness that is the current state of hip-hop (music and culture)--looking out over the ocean at the ever-elusive flashing lights. It's my job to narrate the story and try my best not to judge, simply state facts as I know them to be\n\nInterestingly enough, the Kanye comparison works in this archetypical fashion, and brings many parallels with it. Reality television has given Kim Kardashian a platform to flaunt the excesses of celebrity for the sake of celebrity. She is one of the highest earning reality television stars, and is involved in many business ventures as a result of her reality television fame--quite an ascension from being the daughter of O. J. Simpson's defense attorney and step-daughter of an American Olympic gold medalist. If Kanye is Gatsby, then one could easily make a very basic case for Kim Kardashian being Daisy Buchanan, the self-absorbed party girl/flapper from \"old money\" with whom Gatsby becomes enamored and who sets him on course to create a fantasy in which she can live and he can have her to himself, forever reliving those wonderful moments they shared in their youth; her (ex) husband, Kris Humphries, would perhaps be Tom Buchanan, Daisy's husband, who represents \"old money\" as well, and is a former athlete. Tom could very easily be paralleled to Reggie Bush as well, and perhaps more appropriately so since Kanye's former friend and collaborator, Consequence (2013), revealed (with Jen \"The Pen\" Bayer, the mother of his child), in a January 21, 2013, interview on New York's Power 105.1 Breakfast Club Show, that he'd facilitated meetings between Kim and Kanye while she was dating the NFL star. Consequence, then, would understand Nick Carraway's discomfort when asked to do the very same for Gatsby and Daisy in chapter 4 of the novel, which he eventually does in chapter 5. This is a pivotal moment for Gatsby, because it seems it is the realization of his dream, to have Daisy. His life's work is complete because he has obtained what it is that he has worked so hard to get; whether it's genuinely the love of his life, or if she is a symbol of status, Gatsby has Daisy, and the charade, it seems, is over. He has proven himself, perhaps only to himself. Gatsby calls off his lavish parties, preoccupied with his new \"life\" with Daisy, and Nick, during a visit to the Buchanan home where Gatsby and Jordan Baker are also present, becomes acutely aware of Daisy's disinterest in her and Tom's young child. This is the point at which the reader comes to learn the defining aspects and true nature of all the principal characters in the novel. This is also the beginning of Gatsby's great fall. At this point, the comparison of Gatsby to Kanye becomes more the work of the student than anything, leaving room for contrast and speculation regarding Mr. West's ultimate fate or whether his life can be seen as wholly comparable to that of Gatsby. Nick ultimately becomes aware that the Buchanans are careless people who recklessly go through life doing whatever they please, only to retreat behind their money when anything goes awry. Whatever your opinion of the world and the people who occupy the world in which Kanye West lives, there exists a viable correlation, and if not, at least room for a meaningful discussion on the topic\n\nAs previously stated, I find great interest in the hip-hop love story-- Hip Hop in its Essence and Real--and how this love sets many artists on the same course as Gatsby after he met Daisy, in 1917. And, like Gatsby with Daisy, the artist finds H.E.R. \"excitingly desirable,\" perhaps because the meeting is \"a colossal accident,\" but he still takes \"what he can get, ravenously and unscrupulously,\" and ultimately, after having her finds that he has \"committed himself to the following of a grail,\" feeling \"married to her\" (155-157). The artist finds that he is in love with H.E.R. and will do most anything to havc H.E.R. the way that he had H.E.R. when they first met. Common is disillusioned and despises that he sees H.E.R. comn:ercialized, used, and abused, and vows to \"take her back\" much as Gatsby aims to take Daisy back from Tom. Whereas in Gatsby's case, \"It excited him too that many men had already loved Daisy--it increased her value in his eyes,\" Common feels a bit different (156). Common is obviously displeased with H.E.R. dalliances with other artists because he wants H.E.R. all to himsel\u00a3\n\nKanye West, on his 2008 album Graduation, pays homage to Common's \"I Used to Love H.E.R.\" with \"Homecoming,\" an ode to a \"girl\" he met when he was three years old named \"Wendy.\" His lyrics formulate a well-hidden conceit much like Common's, only to reveal that instead of being a story about \"Hip Hop,\" this is homage to \"Chi-Town.\" Hip hop, by connecting the past to the present\nCreates for future artists a story that merits repeating, remixing, and retelling. If the axiom is true, and all books are indeed about other books, perhaps all songs are about other songs, or, more fittingly, all lyrics are about other lyrics. And maybe, then, the journey of Kanye's to reclaim a \"lost love\" has much less to do with Kim Kardashian as an emblematic status symbol or a reminder of the promise of times past like Daisy,a and snore to do with Hip Hop in its Essence and Real. And perhaps that \"aspirational sparseness\" that he is now testing out is his telling us, as the passage in The Great Gatsby in which Gatsby says to Nick, who cautions him not to get his hopes up about Daisy because their past can't be repeated, \"'Can't repeat the past?' he cried incredulously. 'Why of course you can!'\" (116). Kanye constantly speaks about his duty as an artist to aspire to purity. This, it seems, is the true essence of art for him, and is perhaps what drives him to not only be a fascinating cultural figure, but also solidifies his comparison to Jay Gatsby--the reaching out toward the metaphorical green light at the end of the Buchanan's dock, the willingness to risk all of his successes and accomplishments to push forward and to push back, the need to say and do what he feels needs to be said and done to maintain that purity, the essence of what he sees as H.E.R. In a Rolling Stone (2010) interview about My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy he states:I forget the word, but there's [sic] people throughout history that [sic] their responsibility is to be conveyors of truth on to next generations. There's a word far that type of person. And I feel like I'm that type of person that [sic] has to carry on the truth and tell 'The Story' not 'His Story.' Tell the story; where it's like Raphael's painting Jesus' wish, knowing the pope would have his head but he died before the pope got the piece. But as a [sic] artist he said, \"Yo, I need to express this our I'll die, I'll die inside. This is what I saw, this is what I want to paint as a [sic] artist.\" I feel like artists take their lives to serious or not serious enough. Where, you know, who would really put their life on the line for what they really, really believe in? Who would make a sacrifice?Kanye goes on in the interview to explain that he believes many of his contemporaries to be \"scared,\" saying they \"run away from popular culture,\" and because of this, he sees them as \"falling short of the greatness of Rock 'n' Roll\" (Video Interview1\u00b0). From his humble, anonymous beginnings in the world of hip-hop, produchlg music he was barely credited for doing, to his production work on one of the defining albums in hip-hop history, Jay-Z's Blueprint, Kanye West has aspired to see hip-hop created and performed in its purest essence. In an interview about his debut album, The College Dropout, with Associated Press writer Nekesa Mumbi Moody (2004), West states that his hip-hop aspirations started early, first convincing his mother to loan him money to buy his first keyboard, believing so much in himself and his musical potential that he says, \"I thought I was going get sig toned back when I was 13 years old, and come out with a record and take Kris Kross out\" (1)\n\nThat moment created by Kanyc West in 2004, when he experienced H.E.R., the essence of hip-hop, and brought the world his view of what hip-hop could be--The College Dropout-- created a moment he's been striving to recreate since, as Gatsby did all he could, throwing his lavish weekly parties and befriending her cousin Nick, to create the circumstance in which he could again have a chance encounter with Daisy. Feeling \"married\" in those moments to their respective dreams, both set on a course fprward, by going backward, propelled toward an ideal future by a \"perfect moment\" from their pasts. Nick narrates to readers at the close of the novel, \"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us\" (189). To Gatsby; the green light is a sym- bol of Daisy, of old money, perhaps of wealth in general, of simpler times, of happiness--all ideas associated with the American Dream. As Kanye West has written and recorded songs such as \"All of the Lights,\" \"Flashing Lights,\" and \"Street Lights,\" on topics that could easily be aligned with the ideals of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness--\"The Good Life,\" to use his own words, but also being sure to shine as much light on the \"bad\" as the \"good,\" embracing Langston Hughes's challenge, \"express[ing] [his] individual dark- skinned [self] without fear or shame,\" baring his soul for the sake of art--the dream of any artist (1). Gatsby's fate is sealed, as he is consumed by the world he creates and in which he participates. It's not the implied illegal activities in which he is rumored to be involved, but the fantasy he creates, of picking up from that moment they met and continuing his life with Daisy. Reporter Chris Campion (2011) asks Kanye if he feels as though the success of his debut album is because he \"brought something different back to hip hop\" (1). Kanye replies, \"Well, I don't know how you can bring something different back. You can either bring something that's done back or else bring something different\" (1). The brand of different created by Kanye with H.E.R. has been his aspiration since The College Dropout, to what levels of success he has achieved it is debatable. He has not met Gatsby's fate, though some fans and critics believe the \"old\" Kanye to be no more. To date, Kanye's is a happier tale than Gatsby's: he's both got his dream girl in Kim Kardashian and he's doing his dream job, receiving much critical acclaim for his latest musical contribution, Yeezus. He goes on to tell Campion, \"I guess [I'm] bringing something different. Hip hop is fixated on fantasy\" (1). Unlike Gatsby, Kanye's fantasy has worked out, and he has found a way to successfully live in it\n\nAs for nay part as the \"partially involved narrator,\" I, as Nick, am \"inclined to reserve all judgments\" (5). Maybe, in the end, we will all come to see Kanye in the same light Nick saw Gatsby:...who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life:, as if he were related to one of those machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the \"creative temperament\"--it was his extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.Kanye may very well be hip-hop's Gatsby, representing everything I loathe about the culture while simultaneously embodying ever thing that is beautiful about it as well, because the recognition of those loathsome attributes are simply a reflection--a yin to a yang--of what is beautiful. Perhaps Kanye's life, as Gatsby's could likewise easily be described, is evolving into a beautiful, dark, twisted fantasy into which his sensitivity provides an outlook we consumers, mere outsiders peeking in at (or, through), only register through the binary of \"genius\" or \"crazy\" \"Creative temperament\" is what we tend to call it, because we have--even if he hasn't, and has no reason to--given up hope, and rather than recognize it as the extraordinary gift it is, we mistakenly overlook it in search of something else. We look for another angle: a controversy, a quarrel, a personality flaw, or something even less significant, when we could simply try to view Kanye as Nick saw Gatsby\n\nEventually, we may come to say \"No--Kanye turned out all right in the end; it was what preyed on Kanye, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out our interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.\" (7) And we will realize that he was \"worth the whole damn bunch put together,\" Nick's words to Gatsby at the end of their last meeting, letting Gatsby know that Nick sees him for who he is: A great man who believes in his dream and is willing to sacrifice everything in his quest to reach itYou might also likeEmbed",

I would say - some people would say thoughtless\n\n[Kanye]\nIf I had not done what I felt and I just thought\nThen it would've just never happened\nAnd when I wear that hat it's like a fight for equality\nLike \"oh I can wear this hat too\"\nI think people get mad at me when I name my idols\nAnd I don't say Michael Jordan, I say Disney\n[T.I.]\nI just want you to consider all the people who just might be terribly, like, just torn apart and hurt\n\n[Kanye]\nI really wanna take that hurt off of them and let them understand that I did not wear that hat to hurt them\nHalf the shit Trump does, I don't agree with\n\n[T.I.]\nWhat half do you agree with?\nLet's get that out\n\n[Kanye]\nJust the ability to do what no one said you could do\nTo do the impossible is the most inspiring thing to me\n\n[Kanye, to someone else in the room]\nDid you play that umm, the one that said\n\"Tell Daddy what you learned in school\"\n(Don\u2019t play with that boy?)\nI wanna play with that, yeah\n(Alright, okay)\n\n[Kanye, on a playback of \"Don\u2019t Play With That Boy\"]\n\"I was in debt and the car that broke\nThe same shit I've been saying for years they called it \"loc\"\nSuccessful man, a man that [?] the [?]\nThe most successful man the one's who can afford the most mistakes\nDon\u2019t play with them\"\n[Kanye]\nYou could mix into that cause I basically gave a lotta my side on that\n\n[T.I]\nSure\n\n[Kanye]\nYou know what I'm saying?\nAnd your shit come in, you say\n\"Whoa whoa whoa, what you say?\nHow could that be?\n[murmurs]\"\nYou know what I'm saying?\nThe exact conversation we're having\nAnd what would you say?\n\n[T.I.]\nSure\n\"Yeah I'm just trying to figure where you're trying to go with this\nSome things you don't align with and some shit you just don't go against\"\nThat would kinda [gestures], you know\n\n[T.I., in recording studio]\nLet me hear it bro, let me see what we got here\n\n[T.I. listens on a set of headphones]\n[T.I., recording]\n\"... you're goin' now\n'Cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down\"\n\n[Kanye, recording]\n\"... know everybody emotional\n\"Would it be better if I rapped about selling crack?\nBecause it's cultural?\nOr how about I'ma shoot you? Or fuck your bitch?\nOr how about all this Gucci, or I'm fuckin' rich?\"\n\nOr uhh, I could fuck your bitch\n\n[T.I., recording]\n\"Here's a suggestion, be selective with your critical views\nOf people who done made greater contributions than you\"\n\n[Kanye, on a playback of \"Ye Vs The People\"]\n\"I know Obama was heaven-sent\nBut ever since Trump won, I felt like I could be president\"Embed",
