      "Line: [Hiphop: \"I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper\"] of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that \"Truth\" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off \"Xxplosive\" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on \"This Can't Be Life.\" of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, \"Oh you a real soulful dude.\" of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: [JAY-Z: \"Oh you a real soulful dude, man\"] of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: And he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: [JAY-Z: \"Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here\"] of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: \"Tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, \"What you think of it?\" of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: [JAY-Z: \"So what you think of this?\"] of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: And I was like, \"Man that shit tight,\" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to... of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: [Donda West: \"Come on, let's just go\"] of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: ...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up... of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: [Donda West: \"Kanye, baby, we're here\"] of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: ...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City.\" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: [Hiphop: \"No I think Jay gon' like this one right here\"] of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, \"Yo what's up I'm Kanye.\" of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: [Dame: \"Yo, you that kid, Kanye?\"] of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: \"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats\" of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: [Dame: \"Jay got classics, G.\"] of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, \"Man that was tight.\" of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: [JAY-Z: \"That, that was cool. That was hot.\"] of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them \"Jesus Walks\" and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, \"Naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man... of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: [Jessica: \"Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.\"] of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: [\"Y'all niggas is stupid\"] of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: [Joe: \"We gonna change the game, buddy.\"] of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Dame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\" of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: [Dame: \"You gotta make sure it's not wack.\"] of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.' of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: \"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: I got 11 plaques on my walls right now of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\" of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like \"oh shit\" of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: [Dame: \"Oh shit it's not even wack.\"] of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: \"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\" of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: [Dame: \"it's actually kinda hot.\"] of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like \"yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick\" of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: [Dame: \"you don't wanna catch a brick\"] of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: \"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.\" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer-rapper,\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\" of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: [Mel: \"Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.\"] of Last Call by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?\" of Last Call by Kanye West\n",

      "Line: 1 ContributorMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy Review (Revised) LyricsSince everyone was butthurt over my last review because I pulled a Kanye and gave you what you NEED and not what you WANT, so here is exactly what you want. A nice REVIEW that is not \"for the IQ\" and is indeed a REVIEW, and gives MBDTF a 10/10 like the mainstream says. So I swallowed my pride and downed my \"alt\" opinion and wrote this. (So dramatic). So here its is: of All Of The Lights (Interlude) (Instrumental) by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: In 2010, Kanye West dropped an album that is widely regarded as a classic, because it is one of the best albums on the planet. With magnificent beats and innovative rapping by Kanye, and a slew of amazing guest features, this is the best way to apologize of All Of The Lights (Interlude) (Instrumental) by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: This whole album serves as a sort of \"sorry but not sorry\" apology from Kanye after his stunt at the VMA's. He manages to apologize to the fans with this masterful album, but the lyrics tell you to kiss his ass of All Of The Lights (Interlude) (Instrumental) by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Lyrically, Kanye improves from his last album and production wise he did, too. He takes hours upon hours to make sure that this was the best album he ever released, and I agree. So lets begin: of All Of The Lights (Interlude) (Instrumental) by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 1. Dark Fantasy-10/10 / Kanye comes into this album with unapologetic lyrics, a great beat and wonderful vocals. This starts off the \"fuck everyone\" vibe that carries onto every other song. Kanye's mean-but-sarcastic vocals make the message clear: He doesn't care of All Of The Lights (Interlude) (Instrumental) by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 2. Gorgeous-10/10 / Kid Cudi's wonderful vocals aid this song's deep meaning: this is the apology part of the album. Kanye writes a verse that targets the nuances of the world that most likely caused his anger to come out at the VMA's. He pours himself into this song, I keep listening to it over and over again, I'm drawn in of All Of The Lights (Interlude) (Instrumental) by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 3. Power-10/10 / This fun and upbeat song tells a much different story than the last. Kanye tells us all to kiss his ass, he's not sorry. This change of tone makes the fun sound of this song work. I love the beat, the Schizoid man juxtaposition, and Kanye's great flow and lyricism. The technicality of his verses are spectacular of All Of The Lights (Interlude) (Instrumental) by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 4. All Of The Lights Interlude-10/10 / This amazing instrumental raises the experience of the next track so much, it is masterfully crafted and amazing, it is wonderfully made, and I love it of All Of The Lights (Interlude) (Instrumental) by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 5. All Of The Lights-10/10 / This inspirational song makes you want to get up and do something! Kanye picked the perfect artists to be on the track to make the biggest and best sound. You can just hear the layers and it helps the experience of the tape. It's a magical song of All Of The Lights (Interlude) (Instrumental) by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 6. Monster-10/10 / Nicki killed her verse, it's the best verse I have ever heard from Nicki in her career!

      "Line: 173 ContributorsTop 100 Rap Songs of 2014 Lyrics100. Ghostface Killah ft. AZ, Kool G Rap &  Tre Williams \"The Battlefield\"\"The Battlefield\" is an amazing portrayal of hip-hop's recent evolution. The genre is starting to age, and so are its key musicians. Mafioso rap veterans Ghostface, AZ and Kool G take their adulthood experiences and apply them to the metaphorical battlefield. Never forget - there's a war going on outside.99. Apollo Brown & Rass Kass ft. Pharoahe Monch & Rakaa Iriscience \"H20\"98. Travi$ Scott ft. Big Sean \"Don't Play\"97. Mac Miller ft. Vince Staples \"Rain\"96. Isaiah Rashad ft. SZA \"West Savannah\"95. Vic Mensa\t\"Feel That\"Following his breakout mixtape Innanetape and four appearances on last year’s top 100 song list, Vic Mensa is back with his Smoko Ono produced banger \"Feel That\". The song breaks away from Vic’s reputation as a “lyrical” rapper, substituting lyrical complexity for a strong flow and crazy energy. Vic’s about to take over the game and we feel that!94. Mick Jenkins\tft Joey Bada$$ \"Jerome\"93. Tinashe ft Schoolboy Q \"2 On\"92. Jay Electronica ft. LaTonya Givens \"Better In Tune With The Infinite\"91. Big K.R.I.T. \"King Of The South\"90. PRyhme \"Courtesy\" In classic Premo style, the production is lead by organs and 90's scratched vocal samples. Royce blesses us with two thrilling verses - snarky shots at his competition, sprinkled pop culture references, and packed wordplay. Rapping well is the only way he knows how, and it proves true on this record.89. Childish Gambino \"Sober\"88. NehruvianDOOM \"OM\"87. Drake\t\"How About Now\"86. Statik Selektah ft Action Bronson, Royce da 5'9 & Black Thought \"The Imperial\"85. O.T Genasis\t\"CoCo\"BAKIN' SODA, I GOT BAKIN' SODA!O.T took the internet by storm with this cocaine ballad. His hilariously serious tone combined with references to Nemo and Nino Brown made us all fall in love with the coco, even Nicki Minaj. The biggest fans of this song are O.T's peers - y'all saw what happened to Busta Rhymes, right?84. Vince Staples ft James Fauntleroy \"Nate\"83. Lupe Fiasco ft Ty Dolla $ign \"Deliver\"82. Theophilus London ft Kanye West \"Can't Stop\"81. Future ft. Andre 3000 \"Benz Friends (Whatchutola)\"80. Jay Electronica ft. Jay Z \"We Made It Freestyle\" Jay Electricity and Hova joined forces at the top of the  year to murder Drake & Soulja Boy’s 2013 New Year anthem “We Made It”. The chemistry is undeniable as the two flow effortlessly over the blaring horns. While both dropped serious knowledge on The Five Percent Nation of Islam, every line packs a punch. Exhibit A? Jigga hitting Drizzy square in the jaw with this right hook: “Sorry Mrs. Drizzy for so much art talk/Silly me rappin' 'bout shit that I really bought”79. Beyonce ft. Nicki Minaj \"***Flawless Remix\"78. ScHoolboy Q \"Prescription/Oxymoron\"77. Travis Scott ft Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug \"Mamacita\"76. YG ft. Jay Rock & ScHoolboy Q \"I Just Wanna Party\"75. Dej Loaf\t\"Try Me\"From the moment the muted twinkles of DDS’ “Try Me” beat creeps in, Dej commands the year’s most threatening anthem without ever raising her voice past a Cam’ronian monotone. It runs like a checklist of guaranteed hip-hop success. Hook? Infectious. Flow? Unique, yet copyable by the lay listener. Lyrics? Quotable. But what exalts this song to its heights is Dej Loaf’s undeniable, next-level swagger, one that makes her one rapper you really might not want to try.74. Young Thug ft. A$AP Ferg & Freddie Gibbs \"Old English\"73. Lil Wayne ft. The LOX \"Gotti\"72. Mick Jenkins \"The Waters\"71. Game \"Bigger Than Me\"70. Childish Gambino \"Candler Road\"Bino pays homage to a road in his hometown in Decatur, Atlanta, a fitting name for an instrumental that contains an interpolation of his because the internet song “Telegraph Ave.” The improvised scat hook puts a cherry on top of the seemingly effortless track that stands out as his best rap song of the year.69. Wu-Tang Clan \"Ruckus In B Minor\"68. Kendrick Lamar \"Untitled\"67. OG Maco \"U Guessed It\"66. Drake \"Draft Day\"65. Donnie Trumpet ft. Chance The Rapper & Jamila Woods\t\"Sunday Candy\"The Social Experiment, a.k.a the Chicago “symphony”, switches things up to make a truly heartwarming track. Whether it’s the soul-filled vocals from Jamila Woods & Co, or Chance the Rapper’s two verses, nostalgia oozes out of every corner of this joint. With live instrumentation and composition by SoX, this release sets expectations high for their album SURF.64. ScHoolboy Q \"Hoover Street\"63. Common ft. Vince Staples \"Kingdom\"62. Jay Rock \"Parental Advisory\"61. Freddie Gibbs \"Shitsville\"60. Action Bronson \"Easy Rider\"The psych-rock sampling accompanies Bronsolino's timeless flow like a hot dog at the ball game. Gems like “I had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans. Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin” are classic Bam Bam. \"Easy Rider\" is Mr. Wonderful's acid trip on steroids.59. Eminem\t\"Shady XV\"58. Nicki Minaj \"Anaconda\"57. J.Cole \"January 28th\"56. Run The Jewels ft. boots \"Early\"55. Mac Miller \"Diablo\"Mac hit us with “Diablo”  on his Soundcloud account out of nowhere in February. The chilling piano line and Mac's delivery perfectly complement lyrics like “Contemplating suicide like it’s a DVD / Lost inside my mind, it’s a prison homie leave me be”. The druggy philosopher we all fell in love with is back, and trippier than ever. 54. Freddie Gibbs \"Harold's\"53. Slaughterhouse \"Y'all Ready Know\"52. Logic \"Nikki\"51. Yelawolf \"Till It's Gone\"50. Pharoahe Monch ft. Black Thought \"Rapid Eye Movement\"From the moment the first bar is spat, you know Pharoahe and Tariq aren't strangers to the rap game. \"My think tank's like a piranha tank think, multiple bites figure / Mega, reality, tera, giga\" starts us off with a bang. \"Rapid Eye Movement\" sounds like it belongs in a James Bond movie49. PartyNextDoor ft. Drake \"Recognize\"48. Vic Mensa \"Down On My Luck\"47. PRyhme\t\"PRyhme\"46. Vince Staples \"Blue Suede\"45. Rae Sremmurd\t\"No Flex Zone\"Serving as Rae Sremmurd's debut single, this anthem quickly blew up the charts, clubs and streets to make the oddly named duo the biggest thing in hip hop. In fact, this track was so big that the remix featured two of the hottest rappers in recent times: Nicki Minaj and Pusha T44. Nicki Minaj ft. Chris Brown, Drake & Lil Wayne \"Only\" 43. Joey Bada$$\t\"Big Dusty\"42. Run The Jewels \"Blockbuster Night Pt. 1\"41. Big K.R.I.T.\t\"Cadillactica\"40. Pusha T \"Lunch Money\"What started as an accidental release turned out to be one of the best joints of the year. The G.O.D laid down the Contra style soundtrack, while King Push’s flow was flawless. The drug dealer dichotomy did it again with lines like “What's the price of success? Lost my bitch, bought a chef”. This initial offering has us fiending for King Push, and unlike 2013’s MNIMN, he won’t need a pitch either - the shit sells itself.39. YG ft. Drake \"Who Do You Love\"38. Freddie Gibbs \"Deeper\"37. Mac Miller ft. Da$h & Earl Sweatshirt \"New Faces V2\"36. Rae Sremmurd \"No Type\"35. Isaiah Rashad \"Heavenly Father\"Here Isaiah Rashad delivers dark content over a soulful instrumental, creating a nice contrast between the two. A combination of Rashad's smooth, low-tempo flow, and a melodic hook from SZA, makes this for a heavenly performance. One of the best cuts from Cilvia Demo.34. Wiz Khalifa \"We Dem Boyz\"33. J.Cole \"No Role Modelz\"32. Future ft. Casino, Pharrell Williams & Pusha T \"Move That Dope\"31. Logic \"Soul Food\"30. Eminem ft. Big Sean, Danny Brown, Dej Loaf, Royce Da 5'9 & Trick Trick \"Detroit Vs Everybody\" Detroit up-and-comers Big Sean and Danny Brown come hard enough to successfully bridge the gap between Royce and Em’s bookend verses. Between another show-stealing verse from Royce, a solid hook from Dej Loaf, and an outro from the director of the “No Fly Zone” Trick Trick, this track should keep rival MCs wary of Detroit static for time to come.29. Jay Rock ft. Chantal Kreviazuk & Kendrick Lamar \"Pay For It\"28. Nas \"The Season\"27. Bad Meets Evil \"Vegas\"26. Logic \"Gang Related\"25. Freddie Gibbs ft. Danny Brown \"High\"Gangster Gibbs brings Danny on a marijuana-filled trip, backed with smooth and bass-banging production courtesy of Madlib. Getting high is what they do best, and it's no surprise hearing how well both of them sound on this joint. As expected, Danny's excited and high-registered verse flows perfectly with the beat as Freddie refuses to extinguish the fire.24. T.I ft. Young Thug \"About The Money\"23. Drake \"6 God\"22. Eminem ft. Sia \"Guts Over Fear\"21. Run The Jewels ft. Zack de la Rocha  \"Close Your Eyes (And Count To Fuck)\"20. Mick Jenkins \"Jazz\" Mick rides the beat using his notorious voice conviction skills, and as the beat mellows, his voice mellows; as the beat gets more chaotic, his voice rises. The lyrics, flow, and overall vibe of the song hits your soul and makes a new home. Mick wants us to ignore the lies and corruption in the world - and we already know that this black man ain’t talkin’ all that Jazz.19. Young Jeezy ft. Jay Z \"Seen It All\"Two of hip hop's most renowned hustlers join forces yet again and the result is nothing short of astonishing. The track is a clear highlight on Jeezy's album and one of Jay's finest verses in recent memory. They are both in top form as they vividly depict the experiences of their past drug dealings. You can clearly tell there's a genuine chemistry between the two. Even if you say this song blows - that's still a compliment. It was so real Jay was brought to tears while writing his verse.18. Rick Ross ft. Big Sean & Kanye West \"Sanctified\"Ross gruntFeaturing Big Sean and Kanye West in addition to production by DJ Mustard and West, \"Sanctified\" was easily the most anticipated track from Rozay's 6th album, Mastermind. While Kanye's verse was a PSA to the critics who continually attempt to tarnish his reputation, Ross rapped about grilled cheese and his Rolls Royce Wraith. of Souls Anchored by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Not only did \"Sanctified\" appear #1 on our Top 10 Beats of 2014 list, but it served as the background music for the greatest viral video of all time17. ILOVEMAKONNEN ft. Drake \"Tuesday (Remix)\"I Love Makonnen began 2014 as a relatively unknown artist struggling to gain relevance as a musician, and trying to break free from his manslaughter charges. Then one day...Drizzy decided to drop a verse onto “Tuesday” and nothing was the same. Makonnen sings about his drug dealing past, and his busy schedule forcing him to bend the rules of when clubs can go up. Thanks to this single, clubs will never be the same on a Tuesday.16. J.Cole \t\"Wet Dreamz\"Over a classic sample, Cole gives us his vintage story telling as he reminisces about his first time with a girl. He holds a cool attitude as tells the girl he's a pro - even though he's never had sex before. As thing escalate further, he watches porn videos for pointers and practices putting on a condom before the plot takes a twist right at the end. What's scary is how well this song relates. We guarantee almost every male listener felt some type of way. 15. Lil Wayne ft. Drake \"Believe Me\" The release of \"Believe Me\"  raised Tha Carter V's hype up few notches thanks to the perfect combination of YMCMB's finest. Drake lays down the hook and two stylistically different verses; one that bounces perfectly with the Boi-1da-produced beat, and another with a gritty flow. Wayne matches Drake verse-for-verse and ends the track in memorable fashion of Souls Anchored by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: One of the more underrated aspects of \"Believe Me\"  is its versatility. You can bump it while you’re browsing Genius, driving to work or school, or grinding through a workout. It appeals to all ears, just as we hope the entire album will.14. ScHoolboy Q \"Break tHe Bank\"Complete with a chilling piano line and a Mario Kart 64 sample from The Alchemist, the instrumental is perfect for a modern gangster rapper like ScHoolboy Q. Throughout the track he viciously reminds the listener that it's his time and that he ain't no one to fuck with. With Oxymoron debuting at number one on the billboard charts, and having sold over 320,000 copies, it is safe to say that Q is Breaking the bank. 13. A$AP Rocky ft. Juicy J \"Multiply\"After some uncharacteristic features, A$AP returned with one of the hardest hitting songs of the year in \"Multiply.\" The Flacko flow is on full display from the start; his signature internal rhyming bounces up and down on the beat with such rhythm that it wouldn’t matter if he used to sell crack or lemonade in his living room of Souls Anchored by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Don’t worry, you won’t be seeing an A$AP Lemonade Stand anytime soon as Rocky sticks to his typical rapper and fashion references. Throw in some Juicy J trash talk for good measure and A$AP’s only single since Long.Live.A$AP is one of the year’s best. Swag swag.12. Flying Lotus ft. Kendrick Lamar \"Never Catch Me\"Like a psychedelic rat race, “Never Catch Me”  has Kendrick Lamar running circles around this Flying Lotus masterpiece. The fusion of hip hop, jazz, & electronic styles has Kendrick spazzing like a rabid dog. The L.A natives take you on an outer body experience to stare death right in the face. Every few bars the instrumental changes as the race continues, like Kendrick’s searching for something, getting faster, and faster, and as you reach your destination - “bitch, you’re dead!”11. Joey Bada$$ \"Christ Conscious (Toroidal Flow)\"With an aggressive flow, Joey delivers a barrage of punchlines, wordplay, and utter energy that dazzles any listener. The beauty of these lyrical acrobats continues to prolong Joey’s ability and shows he ain’t no slacker when it comes down to the lyrics. Dragon Balls like his name was Vegeata, BADA$$  swears that no matter what, he won’t stop until he reaches the level of Christ Conscious.10. Run The Jewels \"Oh My Darling Don't Cry\" Anchored by an El-P instrumental that can only be described as manic, the dynamic duo laces the beat with rhymes that are crude, insightful, and simultaneously both. What separates it from other RTJ tracks is the erosion in differences between the styles and personalities of the lead rappers. On RTJ1, Mike and El were characterized as aggressive and philosophical, respectively. But here El has no problem telling you to “run backwards through a field of dicks” as Mike peruses Egyptian scriptures. The chemistry is palpable, the flows are indescribable, and the result is one of the highlights of 2014.9. Rich Gang ft. Birdman, Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug \"Lifestyle\" EUUGHBLAHBEAHELGWLINAHDEWFQLFKQWFN LLLLLLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEEEEEESTYLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEFor a song that made many detractors reconsider Rich Homie Quan’s “one-hit wonder status” and mainstream listeners delve into the Young Thug archives, the unintelligible nature of the lyrics for most listeners was its greatest asset: whatever personal details you added over the beat, you felt like your efforts were putting you on the fast-track to a Dionysian lifestyle of your own.8. ScHoolboy Q ft. BJ The Chicago Kid \"Studio\"ScHoolboy Q put his heart on his sleeve in this banger for the ladies, elaborating on the reality that life as a major musician can be hectic. From touring around the world to TV appearances to, in this case, late nights in the studio, it can be hard to balance a relationship with a busy work schedule.7. J.Cole \"Fire Squad\"If shock factor was what Cole was after with \"Fire Squad\" then he certainly achieved it. After boasting of his greatness in the first two verses, he took an interesting approach: highlighting white appropriation in the music of black culture. Not only did he just observe the sound-jacking, he name dropped some of the most well-known artists to ever do it.6. Bobby Shmurda \"Hot Nigga\"The relationship between artist and subject matter, in the hip-hop and r&b genres especially, is a dangerously liminal one. When Rick Ross gets chastised for portraying a criminal mastermind following his career in law enforcement, are we supposed to then turn around and congratulate Bobby Shmurda and his crew for their string of summer smashes for existing in a realm of authenticity? It wasn’t the lyrics, nor the beat (on its second go-around, no less!) that made Bobby so hot. So when the chant-worthy one-liners become appear as more than fiction, should we cheer? Should we scold? Or should we Shmoney Dance the troubles away?!5. Logic \"Under Pressure\"The title track of the album is reminiscent of Logic’s classic brag pieces, entailing his recent rise in popularity and success. Where the initial four-minute release dropped off is the track’s elegant yet radical style shift - it transitions from his recent material success to a deeply introspective track reflecting on both his past and current state of affairs with family. This track serves as the crown jewel of the album - a diamond created from being under pressure.4. Big Sean ft. E-40 \"I Don't Fuck With You\"Sean Don and Bay Area godfather E-40 went big this year with the anthem for those without fucks to give. This track dropped along with “Paradise”, “4th Quarter”, and “Jit/Juke\" through his website following the announcement of his signing to Roc Nation. The song samples “Say You Love Me”, as part of the exemplary accompaniment of Coach Kanye and DJ Mustard on the beat. His blatantly vulgar lyrics clearly express his lack of interest in those he is not \"down with\" and is reminiscent of “I Don’t Give A Fuck” from Bo$$. While it has been confirmed that the record is not meant to be a shot to anyone in particular (including Naya Rivera with whom he recently split,) the message is still….Who ever I don't fuck with, I still don't fuck with you.3. Big K.R.I.T.\t\"Mt. Olympus\"Post KRIT's 2013 release, King Remembered In Time, more verbal lightning from Krizzle became high in demand, and he delivered. \"Mt. Olympus\" sees K.R.I.T. punish all the heathens of the rap game, showing them there really is a god. The fans wonder, \"Is he rap, is he snap?\". \"Is he bass, is he drank?\" Neither - he is a King Remembered in Time.2. Drake \"0-100/The Catch Up\"If there's one thing we've learned, it's that every song really does sound like Drake featuring Drake. \"Started from the bottom, now we here\" may have been 2013's catchphrase, but \"0 to 100 nigga, real quick\" took 2014 over almost as quickly as fans grabbed the free Soundcloud download of this track after its June release of Souls Anchored by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: The two-part track is a variety pack, filled with braggadocio, meme-worthy lines, and introspective thoughts. What makes \"0 to 100/The Catch Up\" so notable is the instantaneous shift from straight fire bars to a calmer profession of the same sentiment: Drake is perched at the top of the rap game and he's only getting better. That's a scary thought. We've already begun to see Drake back up these claims in his latest releases, and it's safe to say the anticipation for his next full-length project is nearly off the charts.1. Kendrick Lamar \"i\"Backed by funky production reminiscent of the wonder years of soul music, Kendrick broadcasts a message of self love.  The best messages are those easily understood, and Kendrick makes no mistakes with a simple \"I love myself\" of Souls Anchored by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Similar to our number one song last year, Kanye West's \"New Slaves\", every facet of the song’s concept was handled in one spectacularly orchestrated move. Whether it be the record, the music video, or the buzz - each element illustrates the message crystal clear. An anthem isn't created overnight, this song has been in Kendrick all his life. They can lock ya body, they can’t trap ya mind. of Souls Anchored by Kanye West\n",

      "Line: 43 Contributors50 Best Rap Songs of 2015 Lyrics2015's highlight reel stretches far and wide. Drake kicked the year off with \"Know Yourself,\" debutant Vince Staples held the \"Summertime\" down and Pusha T closed the year feeling \"Untouchable.\" Here are the 50 best rap songs of 2015, as voted on by Genius.com visitors. — Michael Heal of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 50. Tyler, the Creator feat. Lil Wayne & Kanye West - \"Smuckers\"Dreams do come true, at least for Tyler, the Creator. While the outspoken rapper had a terrible year in the media, nothing could dampen seeing idols Lil Wayne and Kanye West jump on his track. With the best opening couplet of 2015: “Richer than white people with black kids / Scarier than black people with ideas” Yeezy hopped on his Late Registration flow in arguably his best feature of 2015. Similarly, Weezy takes things back to  Tha Carter II days with two show stopping verses. Although Tyler narrowly escaped being “renegaded,” credit is due for cultivating one of the top tracks of the year. — Ben Carter of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 49. YG - \"Twist My Fingaz\"48. Bryson Tiller - \"Sorry Not Sorry\"47. Rae Sremmurd - \"Come Get Her\"46. Young Thug - \"Best Friend\"45. Future - \"Fuck Up Some Commas\"44. King Los feat. Marsha Ambrosius- \"War\"43. Earl Sweatshirt - \"Faucet\"42. Ty Dolla $ign feat. Future & Rae Sremmurd - \"Blasé\"41. Vic Mensa feat. Kanye West - \"U Mad\"40. Isaiah Rashad - \"Nelly\"Isaiah keeps to the winning formula with producers Chris Calor and The Antydote for his first single since 2014’s Cilvia Demo. The fluid, soothing song sees Rashad provide the personal lyrics he’s known for. The song title refers to the success of rapper Nelly: “Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song” — Rashad embraces individuality and encourages fans to rock out no matter what anyone thinks.. — YahwehSolomon of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 39. Mick Jenkins - \"P's & Q's\"38. Freddie Gibbs - \"Careless\"37. Future feat. Drake - \"Where Ya At\"36. Kanye West feat. Paul McCartney - \"Only One\"35. Travis Scott feat. Kacy Hill - \"90210\"34. Meek Mill feat. Tory Lanez - \"Lord Knows\"33. Jay Rock - \"Gumbo\"32. Action Bronson feat. Chance The Rapper - \"Baby Blue\"31. The Game feat. Drake - \"100\"30. Pusha T - \"Untouchable\"If anyone knows the key to success, it’s Pusha T. Aided by a Biggie sample, King Push flexes his lyrical prowess over a dark Timbaland instrumental. From Donald Trump references, to Birdman disses and pop-culture mentions, Pusha  vacuum packs the wordplay. When it comes to D-Boy rap, Pusha T really is \"Untouchable\". of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: — Michael Heal of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 29. Lupe Fiasco feat. Ayesha Jaco - \"Prisoner 1 & 2\"28. A$AP Rocky - \"L$D\"27. Mac Miller - \"100 Grandkids\"26. Logic feat. Big Lenbo - \"Young Jesus\"25. Post Malone - \"White Iverson\"24. Vince Staples - \"Señorita\"23. Drake & Future - \"Jumpman\"22. Big Sean feat. Drake & Kanye West - \"Blessings\"21. Dr. Dre feat. Marsha Ambrosius, King Mez & Kendrick Lamar - \"Darkside/Gone\"20. Young Thug - \"Check\"God forbid somebody actually started paying Young Thug in checks instead of cash—he makes the stack phone look way too cool. And while no checks show up in the video for “Check,” the rest of the aesthetic stays true to his form: junk food, left-field fashion choices (a Hooters tank-top, anyone?), and a blatant disregard for money. Thug is one of the few artists out there whose videos perfectly capture the song’s intentions, and it succeeds in complementing the turn-up anthem. Unlike other stand-out tracks of his from 2015, “Check” doesn’t see too many vocal twists or absurd lyrics, and that in itself makes for a jarring experience contrary to what’s expected. You never know what you’re going to get out of Young Thug, but you know disappointment isn’t in the cards. — Brian Duricy of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 19. Chance The Rapper feat. Saba - \"Angels\"18. A$AP Rocky feat. Mark Ronson, Rod Stewart & Miguel - \"Everyday\"17. Joey Bada$$ - \"Paper Trail$\"16. Skepta - \"Shutdown\"15. Vince Staples - \"Norf Norf\"14. Earl Sweatshirt - \"Grief\"13. Kanye West feat. Paul McCartney, Theophilus London & Allan Kingdom - \"All Day\"12. Drake - \"Back To Back\"11. Kendrick Lamar - \"The Blacker The Berry\"10. Jay Rock feat. Black Hippy - \"Vice City\"Posse cuts remain the domain of the true hip hop head and Jay Rock’s \"Vice City\" is no exception. Black Hippy houses four of the most lyrical and musically talented rappers in the game, including one who sits atop the rap totem pole. And yet, it was Schoolboy Q who came through with the W. While the crew uses the same flow throughout, Groovy Q adds his own spin, throwing shade at himself, while tempering the verse with some braggadocio. The unique flow that Kendrick introduces on the hook immediately grabs attention, and any track that mentions \"cheese eggs\" gets an iron clad stamp of approval. — Ben Carter of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 9. Lupe Fiasco - \"Mural\"As the title suggests, “Mural” is a sonic painting. Just hearing the opening keys is enough to provoke a dramatic escape. Lupe doesn't so much invite you into his mind as forcibly drop you there. Entranced by the cadence of repeating piano chords, we're at his mercy. The strain of conscious thought oscillates wildly between existential musings, Freudian slips into childhood, and religious opinion pieces. “Mural” is a hip-hop wet dream of lyricism paired with technical ingenuity. — Ben Carter of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 8. Fetty Wap - \"Trap Queen\"“I’m like ‘Hey, what’s up, hello’”: Very few times has a rapper entered stardom with such welcoming first words. “Trap Queen” is the song that launched Fetty Wap into fame, something he saw coming from the moment he heard the beat. And boy, was he right. The song went on to reach the top 40 in fifteen countries, went platinum in five, and was even the most streamed song of the year on Spotify in the US. The one-eyed trapper’s catchy ode to his \"trap queen\" is one of the most successful songs of the year. of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: — MvdS of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 7. Future - \"March Madness\"The haunting piano introduces a pained Future on \"March Madness,\" balancing social commentary with his established ethos. In a year where he made distraught euphoria a tangible feeling, was there any moment more powerful than his howling “Future Hendrix Dirty Sprite legendary!”, an acknowledgement of the destructive forces that allowed his ascent to legendary status? Though he didn’t completely leave his lane like Pusha T did on the standout “Sunshine,” the poignant lines hit hard through the desperation he expressed. Future owned 2015 through his ability to draw multiple guests and subject matters into his orbit, staking the claim for Pluto as its own planet once again. — Brian Duricy of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 6. Travi$ Scott - \"Antidote\"Initially nothing more than “vibes for the summer,” “Antidote” was created as a placeholder for Travis' highly anticipated Rodeo. However upon its immediate popularity, was added to the tracklist last minute, becoming one Travis' most notable songs. The listener is thrust into the passenger seat of Travis’ partying lifestyle the second “Antidote” starts. The rapper’s unique auto-tune infused voice allows him to deliver an infectious summer anthem still being played long after summer's end. — drxw of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 5. Drake - \"Know Yourself\"On the headline song from Drake’s surprise mixtape If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, Drizzy reminisces and reflects: “Runnin' through the six with my woes!” he raps, the lyric quickly becoming the masses favorite catch-phrase. Co-written by Quentin Miller, this would later ignite controversy (fueled by Meek Mill, among others) claiming Miller and other ghost-writers were the predominant source of Drake’s verses. Simple yet powerful production by hit-makers Boi-1da, Vinylz, and Syk Sense give the song a subtle rhythm that packs heat with every note. — Cosmos of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 4. Kendrick Lamar - \"King Kunta\"To describe the funkalious bassline of \"King Kunta\" as \"toe tapping\" would be like calling Dr. Dre \"quite well off.\" It channels James Brown and Michael Jackson to make your body move in ways you didn't know it could. of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Only a rapper at the very top of the game could hope to make a track like this. Kendrick is simultaneously furious and braggadocios. He boasts that he smells of “the powers that be,” and tears into his pseudo-competition: they’re pretending to be his friends whilst cutting him down, sneakily sharing bars, and despite their boasts of greatness, are only providing token competition. After hearing this, a track far beyond the abilities of most artists, it’s hard to disagree. — Vesuvius of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 3. Vince Staples - \"Summertime\"Produced by Clams Casino, the closing track on the first disc of Vince’s debut album Summertime ‘06 is Vince at his most vulnerable. The slowed down, gentle crooning is a drastic change from the harsh, dark style Vince has been known for. It’s honest yearning for companionship and Vince is pouring his heart out in a way we’ve never witnessed before. — YahwehSolomon of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 2. Drake - \"Hotline Bling\" of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Packaged just before the deadly \"Charged Up\" on his OVO Sound Radio show, Drake hid a track so infectious even the most hardened pop deniers struggled to make a case against it. Drake didn't need a number 1 hit, he swept pop culture off it's feet once again with simplicity married with undeniable star power. The video was another stroke of genius, ensuring the song lived well past it's used by date via a mountain of memes and cementing Drake at the very top of the pop-rap totem pole. — Ben Carter of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 1. Kendrick Lamar - \"Alright\" of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: With a precise melding of gritty vocals and an infectious beat, “Alright” is an activist anthem, manifesting a critical juncture in American society. Like a maestro, Kendrick composed a song reflecting the collective psyche of a generation, fraught at once with both political unrest and a desire for reluctant hope. Although the song was inspired by his trip to Africa, the message is a universal ode of hardship and the subsequent struggle for change. of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Even in its lack of particulars, Kendrick does not shy away from making the root of his lamentation clear; specifically naming the police system. While this was met with backlash from some, the song's melodic, chant-like delivery demands to be heard and not silenced, serving as a beacon to the weary; a moment of respite in a year of brutality. Despite this adversity, Kendrick conveys the human spirit as having a resilient characteristic, capable of smiling even in the midst of pain, and fighting on to see another day. of Sunshine by Kanye West\n",

      "Line: One of the most influential songs of the year, it has been sung in times of need and abuse across the world. This shows what an impact Kendrick can make, and it would be a shame not to have it one here. The anthem of “keeping your head up”, this song can help anyone through tough times of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Nigga, we gon' be alright of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright31. March Madness by Future30. Canal St. by A$AP Rocky29. They.Resurrect.Over.New by Lupe Fiasco (feat. Ab-Soul & Troi) of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: The dream duo meet up again, and it goes hard. Lupe raps laps around this fast paced, Tron themed track, while Soulo does his best lyrical stoner verse. Both bring heavy wordplay, deep metaphors, and awesome punchlines. With Troi on the dope hook, this song never gets old. The lyrical duo met in heaven, and brought some of it back down to Earth of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Meditate until there's no mind of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Decorate me with shine till I go blind of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: BDSM dominated it with no bind of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Safe word is don't stop, both or don't go no times28. Rambo by Bryson Tiller of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Seamlessly switching between hard trap and R&B crooning, Bryson brings his hardest song yet with this banger. Filled with trap-alized sounds of gunshots mixed with his killer hook, Bryson cooked up a real sweet mix. His verses take over to the gritty trap side, but his melodic voice smoothes it all over. With a nice production, Bryson really puts the trap in soul. He fuckin' killed 'em like Rambo! of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 27. Diamonds Dancing by Drake & Future26. Wesley’s Theory by Kendrick Lamar of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: “Wesley’s Theory” is the definition of funky. With the beat consisting mainly of wailing G-funk synths courtesy of Flying Lotus and an incredible bassline courtesy of Thundercat, and other elements including a spoken bridge from legend Dr. Dre and amazing guest vocals from George Clinton as well as the aforementioned Thundercat, this song wouldn’t feel out of place at all on a 1990s West Coast rap album. The song is just executed so well overall that I can let Kendrick’s somewhat mediocre chorus slide. In addition, Kendrick’s lyrics and delivery are top-tier. The lyrics sum up the essence of the first section of To Pimp a Butterfly perfectly, with Kendrick rapping about his life goals in a very creative way. In addition, his vocal inflections in the second verse are so perfect that I can’t even get over it. Overall, “Wesley’s Theory” is an incredible track and easily one of the best songs of 2015 of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: -RIPInspectahDUCK of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 25. Alchemy by Mick Jenkins of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Mick Jenkins completely changed his pace and style with this hard, aggressive song. Rich with wordplay, and continuing his water metaphor, this song goes all the way, taking his best lyrical skills and flow and putting it into this one dope track. Too bad it's so short of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 24. Often by The WeekndShe asked me if I do this every day, I said \"Often\" of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Asked how many times she rode the wave, \"Not so often\"23. Check by Young Thug22. Pornography by Travi$ Scott21. Madonna (And Other Mothers In The Hood) by Lupe Fiasco of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: The most powerful track off of Tetsuo & Youth, Lupe puts all of his feeling and emotion into this track, and you can feel it. With multiple beautiful hooks from Nikki Jean and lots of nice bridges, Lupe tells two stories simultaneously: the story of Jesus, and the story of a young boy, killed by feinds high off angel dust. With each line being dense with wordplay, metaphor and entendres, and each word hitting hard and home, this is definitely one of Lupe’s best songs. I have never cried from a song before, but every time I hear this song I die a little inside. Man tears, man tears of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Them dope fiends and that water, yeah of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",

      "Line: Said you gon' live here foreverOnly child, the holy mama's your mama now20. Pacifier by Young Thug19. You & The 6 by Drake of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Drake just oozes emotion and love in this personal, vulnerable ode to his mother. It sounds like you are eavesdropping on a private conversation between him and his mother, and believe me, it get's hella personal. Drake has never shown this much of himself in his music before, and it's great. He finally finds the perfect balance between trying to be a big man and crying over the phone of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 18. No. 99 by Joey Bada$$ of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Joey returns from last years hit Christ Conscious with another, more awesome song/ Joey shows us his lyrical power and kills his verses. This is a lyrical war, and Joey is winning of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 17. u by Kendrick Lamar of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Kendrick has proved that he can write uplifting, loving anthems, so now he drags us down to the depths of his despair with this emotion packed song. His vocal range goes to extreme lengths like never before while he cries over a bottle of liquor. He proves why he is such a great artist, this song is so touching that you gotta love it of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 16. Fine Whine (feat. Future & Joe fox)15. Maria I’m Drunk (feat. Young Thug & Justin Bieber)14. Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye II (LPFJ2) by A$AP Rocky of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: The return of the legend, the badass, the Pretty Flacko. Rocky comes in with an amazing beat, and hard hitting trap lyrics, with wordplay that will make you wanna dance. This song is one of Rocky’s best, and it will have you chanting “Flacko, Jodye”! of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",

      "Line: Another day in sunny California12. Untouchable by Pusha T of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Pusha T returns with his best track since Numbers On The Boards, absolutely chock full of dense wordplay and intense lyricism. There are no misplaced lines here, and no bad lines either. Pusha shows us why he’s the best lyricist around. Complete with magnificent production and a fitting Biggie Sample, this track can be enjoyed by all rap fans of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 11. Adoration of the Magi by Lupe Fiasco10. King Kunta by Kendrick Lamar of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Described by Kendrick before it’s release, he called it “unapologetically black”, and believe me, it is. The best banger off of To Pimp A Butterfly, this song is sure to make your day of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 9. Money Trees Deuce by Jay Rock of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: After murdering his verse on the first Money Trees, Rock comes back with an even better one. One of the only good songs on a throwaway album, Rock sounds even more intense and convincing. It brings a much more urgent, running out of time feel, and it’s great. Rock kills it of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 8. When in Rome by Mac Miller of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Mac Miller comes in with a savage, radical  song that goes hard all the way.

      "Line: 7. Chopper by Lupe Fiasco (feat. Trouble, Billy Blue, Buk, Glasses Malone, Trae Tha Truth & Famlay) of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Lupe brings together seven of the most real, gritty rappers he could find for an insanely gritty track. Sounding nothing like Lupe's usual work, this song bangs hard. The hook is some of the most trap lyrics you will ever hear, and all artists bring their A-game. This track is eleven minutes of pure heaven, and it's hard finding a better track of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: My baby mama done fucked up on her food stamps of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",

      "Line: 3. Prisoner 1 & 2 by Lupe Fiasco of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Another great song by Lupe, this time with more feeling and content. He tackles incarceration and racial profiling throughout, and he conveys his emotion well. On Prisoner 2, his anger shines through like on The Blacker The Berry. Lupe keeps the wordplay and metaphors consistent throughout, this song is positively perfect of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 2. The Blacker the Berry by Kendrick Lamar of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Kendrick Lamar fires back at the world with this harsh, intense, hard and shocking track. He kills three verses with racial, aggressive and badass punchlines before finally shocking us with the biggest twist ending I’ve heard in a long time. His anger is so evident throughout the song and the racial motive throughout rivals Malcolm X. Kendrick displays his emotions even better than in Collect Calls. This track is so incredible, this is why Kendrick is who he is of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: 1. Mural by Lupe Fiasco of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: This is by far the most lyrical song of the year. Maybe of all time. This is just nine straight minutes of complete and utter fire. Double entendre after double entendre, wordplay within wordplay, metaphors within metaphors. With little riddles hidden throughout, and moments of very deep thought and thought inspiring lines. This is the true value of that fire emoji and all those gif’s you keep posting. This is the pinnacle of rap of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Note: some songs were singles from 2014, but later featured on 2015 albums, and since they already appeared on last years list I excluded them. And other songs (e.i. Codeine Crazy) were released in late 2014, and didn't make any of last years list so I put them here of Count Your Blessings by Kanye West\n",

      "Line: 173 ContributorsTop 100 Rap Songs of 2014 Lyrics100. Ghostface Killah ft. AZ, Kool G Rap &  Tre Williams \"The Battlefield\"\"The Battlefield\" is an amazing portrayal of hip-hop's recent evolution. The genre is starting to age, and so are its key musicians. Mafioso rap veterans Ghostface, AZ and Kool G take their adulthood experiences and apply them to the metaphorical battlefield. Never forget - there's a war going on outside.99. Apollo Brown & Rass Kass ft. Pharoahe Monch & Rakaa Iriscience \"H20\"98. Travi$ Scott ft. Big Sean \"Don't Play\"97. Mac Miller ft. Vince Staples \"Rain\"96. Isaiah Rashad ft. SZA \"West Savannah\"95. Vic Mensa\t\"Feel That\"Following his breakout mixtape Innanetape and four appearances on last year’s top 100 song list, Vic Mensa is back with his Smoko Ono produced banger \"Feel That\". The song breaks away from Vic’s reputation as a “lyrical” rapper, substituting lyrical complexity for a strong flow and crazy energy. Vic’s about to take over the game and we feel that!94. Mick Jenkins\tft Joey Bada$$ \"Jerome\"93. Tinashe ft Schoolboy Q \"2 On\"92. Jay Electronica ft. LaTonya Givens \"Better In Tune With The Infinite\"91. Big K.R.I.T. \"King Of The South\"90. PRyhme \"Courtesy\" In classic Premo style, the production is lead by organs and 90's scratched vocal samples. Royce blesses us with two thrilling verses - snarky shots at his competition, sprinkled pop culture references, and packed wordplay. Rapping well is the only way he knows how, and it proves true on this record.89. Childish Gambino \"Sober\"88. NehruvianDOOM \"OM\"87. Drake\t\"How About Now\"86. Statik Selektah ft Action Bronson, Royce da 5'9 & Black Thought \"The Imperial\"85. O.T Genasis\t\"CoCo\"BAKIN' SODA, I GOT BAKIN' SODA!O.T took the internet by storm with this cocaine ballad. His hilariously serious tone combined with references to Nemo and Nino Brown made us all fall in love with the coco, even Nicki Minaj. The biggest fans of this song are O.T's peers - y'all saw what happened to Busta Rhymes, right?84. Vince Staples ft James Fauntleroy \"Nate\"83. Lupe Fiasco ft Ty Dolla $ign \"Deliver\"82. Theophilus London ft Kanye West \"Can't Stop\"81. Future ft. Andre 3000 \"Benz Friends (Whatchutola)\"80. Jay Electronica ft. Jay Z \"We Made It Freestyle\" Jay Electricity and Hova joined forces at the top of the  year to murder Drake & Soulja Boy’s 2013 New Year anthem “We Made It”. The chemistry is undeniable as the two flow effortlessly over the blaring horns. While both dropped serious knowledge on The Five Percent Nation of Islam, every line packs a punch. Exhibit A? Jigga hitting Drizzy square in the jaw with this right hook: “Sorry Mrs. Drizzy for so much art talk/Silly me rappin' 'bout shit that I really bought”79. Beyonce ft. Nicki Minaj \"***Flawless Remix\"78. ScHoolboy Q \"Prescription/Oxymoron\"77. Travis Scott ft Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug \"Mamacita\"76. YG ft. Jay Rock & ScHoolboy Q \"I Just Wanna Party\"75. Dej Loaf\t\"Try Me\"From the moment the muted twinkles of DDS’ “Try Me” beat creeps in, Dej commands the year’s most threatening anthem without ever raising her voice past a Cam’ronian monotone. It runs like a checklist of guaranteed hip-hop success. Hook? Infectious. Flow? Unique, yet copyable by the lay listener. Lyrics? Quotable. But what exalts this song to its heights is Dej Loaf’s undeniable, next-level swagger, one that makes her one rapper you really might not want to try.74. Young Thug ft. A$AP Ferg & Freddie Gibbs \"Old English\"73. Lil Wayne ft. The LOX \"Gotti\"72. Mick Jenkins \"The Waters\"71. Game \"Bigger Than Me\"70. Childish Gambino \"Candler Road\"Bino pays homage to a road in his hometown in Decatur, Atlanta, a fitting name for an instrumental that contains an interpolation of his because the internet song “Telegraph Ave.” The improvised scat hook puts a cherry on top of the seemingly effortless track that stands out as his best rap song of the year.69. Wu-Tang Clan \"Ruckus In B Minor\"68. Kendrick Lamar \"Untitled\"67. OG Maco \"U Guessed It\"66. Drake \"Draft Day\"65. Donnie Trumpet ft. Chance The Rapper & Jamila Woods\t\"Sunday Candy\"The Social Experiment, a.k.a the Chicago “symphony”, switches things up to make a truly heartwarming track. Whether it’s the soul-filled vocals from Jamila Woods & Co, or Chance the Rapper’s two verses, nostalgia oozes out of every corner of this joint. With live instrumentation and composition by SoX, this release sets expectations high for their album SURF.64. ScHoolboy Q \"Hoover Street\"63. Common ft. Vince Staples \"Kingdom\"62. Jay Rock \"Parental Advisory\"61. Freddie Gibbs \"Shitsville\"60. Action Bronson \"Easy Rider\"The psych-rock sampling accompanies Bronsolino's timeless flow like a hot dog at the ball game. Gems like “I had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans. Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin” are classic Bam Bam. \"Easy Rider\" is Mr. Wonderful's acid trip on steroids.59. Eminem\t\"Shady XV\"58. Nicki Minaj \"Anaconda\"57. J.Cole \"January 28th\"56. Run The Jewels ft. boots \"Early\"55. Mac Miller \"Diablo\"Mac hit us with “Diablo”  on his Soundcloud account out of nowhere in February. The chilling piano line and Mac's delivery perfectly complement lyrics like “Contemplating suicide like it’s a DVD / Lost inside my mind, it’s a prison homie leave me be”. The druggy philosopher we all fell in love with is back, and trippier than ever. 54. Freddie Gibbs \"Harold's\"53. Slaughterhouse \"Y'all Ready Know\"52. Logic \"Nikki\"51. Yelawolf \"Till It's Gone\"50. Pharoahe Monch ft. Black Thought \"Rapid Eye Movement\"From the moment the first bar is spat, you know Pharoahe and Tariq aren't strangers to the rap game. \"My think tank's like a piranha tank think, multiple bites figure / Mega, reality, tera, giga\" starts us off with a bang. \"Rapid Eye Movement\" sounds like it belongs in a James Bond movie49. PartyNextDoor ft. Drake \"Recognize\"48. Vic Mensa \"Down On My Luck\"47. PRyhme\t\"PRyhme\"46. Vince Staples \"Blue Suede\"45. Rae Sremmurd\t\"No Flex Zone\"Serving as Rae Sremmurd's debut single, this anthem quickly blew up the charts, clubs and streets to make the oddly named duo the biggest thing in hip hop. In fact, this track was so big that the remix featured two of the hottest rappers in recent times: Nicki Minaj and Pusha T44. Nicki Minaj ft. Chris Brown, Drake & Lil Wayne \"Only\" 43. Joey Bada$$\t\"Big Dusty\"42. Run The Jewels \"Blockbuster Night Pt. 1\"41. Big K.R.I.T.\t\"Cadillactica\"40. Pusha T \"Lunch Money\"What started as an accidental release turned out to be one of the best joints of the year. The G.O.D laid down the Contra style soundtrack, while King Push’s flow was flawless. The drug dealer dichotomy did it again with lines like “What's the price of success? Lost my bitch, bought a chef”. This initial offering has us fiending for King Push, and unlike 2013’s MNIMN, he won’t need a pitch either - the shit sells itself.39. YG ft. Drake \"Who Do You Love\"38. Freddie Gibbs \"Deeper\"37. Mac Miller ft. Da$h & Earl Sweatshirt \"New Faces V2\"36. Rae Sremmurd \"No Type\"35. Isaiah Rashad \"Heavenly Father\"Here Isaiah Rashad delivers dark content over a soulful instrumental, creating a nice contrast between the two. A combination of Rashad's smooth, low-tempo flow, and a melodic hook from SZA, makes this for a heavenly performance. One of the best cuts from Cilvia Demo.34. Wiz Khalifa \"We Dem Boyz\"33. J.Cole \"No Role Modelz\"32. Future ft. Casino, Pharrell Williams & Pusha T \"Move That Dope\"31. Logic \"Soul Food\"30. Eminem ft. Big Sean, Danny Brown, Dej Loaf, Royce Da 5'9 & Trick Trick \"Detroit Vs Everybody\" Detroit up-and-comers Big Sean and Danny Brown come hard enough to successfully bridge the gap between Royce and Em’s bookend verses. Between another show-stealing verse from Royce, a solid hook from Dej Loaf, and an outro from the director of the “No Fly Zone” Trick Trick, this track should keep rival MCs wary of Detroit static for time to come.29. Jay Rock ft. Chantal Kreviazuk & Kendrick Lamar \"Pay For It\"28. Nas \"The Season\"27. Bad Meets Evil \"Vegas\"26. Logic \"Gang Related\"25. Freddie Gibbs ft. Danny Brown \"High\"Gangster Gibbs brings Danny on a marijuana-filled trip, backed with smooth and bass-banging production courtesy of Madlib. Getting high is what they do best, and it's no surprise hearing how well both of them sound on this joint. As expected, Danny's excited and high-registered verse flows perfectly with the beat as Freddie refuses to extinguish the fire.24. T.I ft. Young Thug \"About The Money\"23. Drake \"6 God\"22. Eminem ft. Sia \"Guts Over Fear\"21. Run The Jewels ft. Zack de la Rocha  \"Close Your Eyes (And Count To Fuck)\"20. Mick Jenkins \"Jazz\" Mick rides the beat using his notorious voice conviction skills, and as the beat mellows, his voice mellows; as the beat gets more chaotic, his voice rises. The lyrics, flow, and overall vibe of the song hits your soul and makes a new home. Mick wants us to ignore the lies and corruption in the world - and we already know that this black man ain’t talkin’ all that Jazz.19. Young Jeezy ft. Jay Z \"Seen It All\"Two of hip hop's most renowned hustlers join forces yet again and the result is nothing short of astonishing. The track is a clear highlight on Jeezy's album and one of Jay's finest verses in recent memory. They are both in top form as they vividly depict the experiences of their past drug dealings. You can clearly tell there's a genuine chemistry between the two. Even if you say this song blows - that's still a compliment. It was so real Jay was brought to tears while writing his verse.18. Rick Ross ft. Big Sean & Kanye West \"Sanctified\"Ross gruntFeaturing Big Sean and Kanye West in addition to production by DJ Mustard and West, \"Sanctified\" was easily the most anticipated track from Rozay's 6th album, Mastermind. While Kanye's verse was a PSA to the critics who continually attempt to tarnish his reputation, Ross rapped about grilled cheese and his Rolls Royce Wraith. of Souls Anchored by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Not only did \"Sanctified\" appear #1 on our Top 10 Beats of 2014 list, but it served as the background music for the greatest viral video of all time17. ILOVEMAKONNEN ft. Drake \"Tuesday (Remix)\"I Love Makonnen began 2014 as a relatively unknown artist struggling to gain relevance as a musician, and trying to break free from his manslaughter charges. Then one day...Drizzy decided to drop a verse onto “Tuesday” and nothing was the same. Makonnen sings about his drug dealing past, and his busy schedule forcing him to bend the rules of when clubs can go up. Thanks to this single, clubs will never be the same on a Tuesday.16. J.Cole \t\"Wet Dreamz\"Over a classic sample, Cole gives us his vintage story telling as he reminisces about his first time with a girl. He holds a cool attitude as tells the girl he's a pro - even though he's never had sex before. As thing escalate further, he watches porn videos for pointers and practices putting on a condom before the plot takes a twist right at the end. What's scary is how well this song relates. We guarantee almost every male listener felt some type of way. 15. Lil Wayne ft. Drake \"Believe Me\" The release of \"Believe Me\"  raised Tha Carter V's hype up few notches thanks to the perfect combination of YMCMB's finest. Drake lays down the hook and two stylistically different verses; one that bounces perfectly with the Boi-1da-produced beat, and another with a gritty flow. Wayne matches Drake verse-for-verse and ends the track in memorable fashion of Souls Anchored by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: One of the more underrated aspects of \"Believe Me\"  is its versatility. You can bump it while you’re browsing Genius, driving to work or school, or grinding through a workout. It appeals to all ears, just as we hope the entire album will.14. ScHoolboy Q \"Break tHe Bank\"Complete with a chilling piano line and a Mario Kart 64 sample from The Alchemist, the instrumental is perfect for a modern gangster rapper like ScHoolboy Q. Throughout the track he viciously reminds the listener that it's his time and that he ain't no one to fuck with. With Oxymoron debuting at number one on the billboard charts, and having sold over 320,000 copies, it is safe to say that Q is Breaking the bank. 13. A$AP Rocky ft. Juicy J \"Multiply\"After some uncharacteristic features, A$AP returned with one of the hardest hitting songs of the year in \"Multiply.\" The Flacko flow is on full display from the start; his signature internal rhyming bounces up and down on the beat with such rhythm that it wouldn’t matter if he used to sell crack or lemonade in his living room of Souls Anchored by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Don’t worry, you won’t be seeing an A$AP Lemonade Stand anytime soon as Rocky sticks to his typical rapper and fashion references. Throw in some Juicy J trash talk for good measure and A$AP’s only single since Long.Live.A$AP is one of the year’s best. Swag swag.12. Flying Lotus ft. Kendrick Lamar \"Never Catch Me\"Like a psychedelic rat race, “Never Catch Me”  has Kendrick Lamar running circles around this Flying Lotus masterpiece. The fusion of hip hop, jazz, & electronic styles has Kendrick spazzing like a rabid dog. The L.A natives take you on an outer body experience to stare death right in the face. Every few bars the instrumental changes as the race continues, like Kendrick’s searching for something, getting faster, and faster, and as you reach your destination - “bitch, you’re dead!”11. Joey Bada$$ \"Christ Conscious (Toroidal Flow)\"With an aggressive flow, Joey delivers a barrage of punchlines, wordplay, and utter energy that dazzles any listener. The beauty of these lyrical acrobats continues to prolong Joey’s ability and shows he ain’t no slacker when it comes down to the lyrics. Dragon Balls like his name was Vegeata, BADA$$  swears that no matter what, he won’t stop until he reaches the level of Christ Conscious.10. Run The Jewels \"Oh My Darling Don't Cry\" Anchored by an El-P instrumental that can only be described as manic, the dynamic duo laces the beat with rhymes that are crude, insightful, and simultaneously both. What separates it from other RTJ tracks is the erosion in differences between the styles and personalities of the lead rappers. On RTJ1, Mike and El were characterized as aggressive and philosophical, respectively. But here El has no problem telling you to “run backwards through a field of dicks” as Mike peruses Egyptian scriptures. The chemistry is palpable, the flows are indescribable, and the result is one of the highlights of 2014.9. Rich Gang ft. Birdman, Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug \"Lifestyle\" EUUGHBLAHBEAHELGWLINAHDEWFQLFKQWFN LLLLLLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEEEEEESTYLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEFor a song that made many detractors reconsider Rich Homie Quan’s “one-hit wonder status” and mainstream listeners delve into the Young Thug archives, the unintelligible nature of the lyrics for most listeners was its greatest asset: whatever personal details you added over the beat, you felt like your efforts were putting you on the fast-track to a Dionysian lifestyle of your own.8. ScHoolboy Q ft. BJ The Chicago Kid \"Studio\"ScHoolboy Q put his heart on his sleeve in this banger for the ladies, elaborating on the reality that life as a major musician can be hectic. From touring around the world to TV appearances to, in this case, late nights in the studio, it can be hard to balance a relationship with a busy work schedule.7. J.Cole \"Fire Squad\"If shock factor was what Cole was after with \"Fire Squad\" then he certainly achieved it. After boasting of his greatness in the first two verses, he took an interesting approach: highlighting white appropriation in the music of black culture. Not only did he just observe the sound-jacking, he name dropped some of the most well-known artists to ever do it.6. Bobby Shmurda \"Hot Nigga\"The relationship between artist and subject matter, in the hip-hop and r&b genres especially, is a dangerously liminal one. When Rick Ross gets chastised for portraying a criminal mastermind following his career in law enforcement, are we supposed to then turn around and congratulate Bobby Shmurda and his crew for their string of summer smashes for existing in a realm of authenticity? It wasn’t the lyrics, nor the beat (on its second go-around, no less!) that made Bobby so hot. So when the chant-worthy one-liners become appear as more than fiction, should we cheer? Should we scold? Or should we Shmoney Dance the troubles away?!5. Logic \"Under Pressure\"The title track of the album is reminiscent of Logic’s classic brag pieces, entailing his recent rise in popularity and success. Where the initial four-minute release dropped off is the track’s elegant yet radical style shift - it transitions from his recent material success to a deeply introspective track reflecting on both his past and current state of affairs with family. This track serves as the crown jewel of the album - a diamond created from being under pressure.4. Big Sean ft. E-40 \"I Don't Fuck With You\"Sean Don and Bay Area godfather E-40 went big this year with the anthem for those without fucks to give. This track dropped along with “Paradise”, “4th Quarter”, and “Jit/Juke\" through his website following the announcement of his signing to Roc Nation. The song samples “Say You Love Me”, as part of the exemplary accompaniment of Coach Kanye and DJ Mustard on the beat. His blatantly vulgar lyrics clearly express his lack of interest in those he is not \"down with\" and is reminiscent of “I Don’t Give A Fuck” from Bo$$. While it has been confirmed that the record is not meant to be a shot to anyone in particular (including Naya Rivera with whom he recently split,) the message is still….Who ever I don't fuck with, I still don't fuck with you.3. Big K.R.I.T.\t\"Mt. Olympus\"Post KRIT's 2013 release, King Remembered In Time, more verbal lightning from Krizzle became high in demand, and he delivered. \"Mt. Olympus\" sees K.R.I.T. punish all the heathens of the rap game, showing them there really is a god. The fans wonder, \"Is he rap, is he snap?\". \"Is he bass, is he drank?\" Neither - he is a King Remembered in Time.2. Drake \"0-100/The Catch Up\"If there's one thing we've learned, it's that every song really does sound like Drake featuring Drake. \"Started from the bottom, now we here\" may have been 2013's catchphrase, but \"0 to 100 nigga, real quick\" took 2014 over almost as quickly as fans grabbed the free Soundcloud download of this track after its June release of Souls Anchored by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: The two-part track is a variety pack, filled with braggadocio, meme-worthy lines, and introspective thoughts. What makes \"0 to 100/The Catch Up\" so notable is the instantaneous shift from straight fire bars to a calmer profession of the same sentiment: Drake is perched at the top of the rap game and he's only getting better. That's a scary thought.

      "Line: 11 ContributorsKanye West: A Brand-New Ye LyricsKanye West has been married for ten days, and he has that new-husband way with the ring still, pulling it on and off like it's something he might yet undo, or do again. The ring is gold, and understated in a way that not much else about Kanye West is. He sits in the lobby of New York's Mercer Hotel—the same hotel where he and Jay Z recorded most of Watch the Throne—reflecting on the distance he's come. \"I am a black American male from Chicago,\" West says, \"who had my rehearsal dinner at Versailles and then got married in Florence with a view of the entire city.\" of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: He is one year removed from Yeezus, the record that took all of West's prodigious pop gifts and made a show of immolating them one by one. He is one year removed from telling anyone who'd listen that he was going to burn the entire fashion industry down, or at least he would once they let him through the door. Now they kind of have: He's got a capsule collection with A.P.C. out now; a line with Adidas that debuts with footwear this fall; and somewhere off in the distance, a new menswear line. He's also got a new record—maybe even a full-on pop record, though he hasn't decided yet. He knows he is no longer the most popular man in rap. \"Currently that spot is taken,\" West says. \"Let's be honest—he got last summer.\" of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Who? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: \"You know. There's only one person.\" of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Drake? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: \"Yeah. He got last summer. And I'd never given it up till last summer.\" Now he's thinking about taking it back. \"It's a real question for me. Do I want to?\" of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Meanwhile, he's reckoning with what it is to be a father and a husband and a decent human. He's happier now—\"You see I haven't name-dropped and said a bunch of negative stuff about people,\" he says at one point—but no less homicidally competitive or less convinced that he's the next Steve Jobs. He'd like to spend more time with his family. He'd also still like to build amusement parks. It's a contradiction, one he's only begun to resolve. And all the while, he can't go outside with his wife, Kim Kardashian, without having his photo taken. His entire waking life has become a performance, a manifesto, a fashion shoot of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Most of the time, he's cool with that fact. But not always. \"I hope we don't see no paparazzi today,\" West says. \"Because I'm still getting acquainted with these jogging pants I threw on. Like, 'That's not my statement!'\t\" of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: You got married a week ago. You're the lead subject in practically every tabloid on the planet right now. Are you comfortable in that position, having that many eyes on you? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: That wasn't my goal. My goal is just to be respected as a man when I walk down the street with my family. I don't care what your job is, you're not gonna talk down to me, you're not gonna try to get a rise out of me. I'm a man first. And in establishing that, some interesting things have happened. [laughs] of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Like that TMZ video from last year, where you're walking with your pregnant fiancée with your head down to avoid the paparazzi, to the point where you walked into a sign and hit your head. Then TMZ made fun of you for walking into the sign. How do you live like that? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: It's difficult. And then put on top of that the idea of going and taking meetings with people, and people say, \"We don't want to work with you, because we saw you get mad about running into the sign.\" of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Does that kind of mockery feel like an effort to de-fang you? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: But also, there's no fangs. I don't have fangs. I'm a porcupine. I'm a blowfish. Like, I'm a—what's the fish that blows up? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: A blowfish? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Yeah. I'm a blowfish. I'm not a shark, I'm a blowfish. So that perfect example about me hitting my head, it's like a blowfish. I wasn't coming out of my house going to a paparazzi's house to attack them. I'm defending my family in front of my own house. I'm defending my name as someone's screaming something negative at me. That's a blowfish. People have me pinned as a shark or a predator in some way, and in no way am I that. I wouldn't want to hurt anyone. I want to defend people. I want to help people of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Can I read you something? The New York Post's Page Six has an account of your wedding that reads, in part: \"Kanye returned one hour before the wedding and didn't like the all-white bar that was in front of the Gold Toilet Tower. He took a saw and started sawing it in half himself. Two men held the bar stable as he sawed, and sawed, into the bar, defacing the entire front, screaming at everyone around him. He said it looked like a bar from Texas. Then he ordered two pieces of raw wood to be nailed onto the front of the bar. Once the wood was in place, 'Now,' he said, 'it's art.' The Italian construction teams looked at this guy and couldn't believe what they were seeing.\" of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: For the person that wrote that, were they involved with anything last year that was as culturally significant as the Yeezus tour or that album? They didn't even talk there about the photographs, or the dress, or Andrea Bocelli singing, or the marble tables. They're like: \"It's a gold toilet.\" No. The bathrooms—that usually would be a porta-potty—were wrapped in a fabric that was neutral to match the fort. The bar was terrible, and the wedding planner didn't approve it with me. I was having issues with this wedding planner the entire time on approvals, and I get there and they threw some weird plastic bar there. So the same materials that were used to cover the bathroom, we said, \"Let's just use that, because this is all we have to make the bar look better.\" Which it did, in the end. And anyone knows that you cannot pick up tools yourself, because of—what are those rules about the workers? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Unions? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Yeah, unions. You can't do that. It's illegal. That's false of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Then they say you gave a forty-five-minute toast to yourself of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: And what I talked about in it was the idea of celebrity, and celebrities being treated like blacks were in the '60s, having no rights, and the fact that people can slander your name. I said that in the toast. And I had to say this in a position where I, from the art world, am marrying Kim. And how we're going to fight to raise the respect level for celebrities so that my daughter can live a more normal life. She didn't choose to be a celebrity. But she is. So I'm going to fight to make sure she has a better life of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: How does it feel when you read something like that account of your wedding or you see a photo of you looking glum at a zipline go viral? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: My feelings don't matter anymore of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Of course they do of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: No. One of the things that I said at the speech was, anyone that's at this table has had to defend me or Kim or both of us at some point in their life. Ask a boxer: \"In the third round, when he hit you from the side on your ear, how did that specifically feel?\" You wouldn't ask a boxer that. Because you know they're there to fight. Meaning now you know I'm here to fight. I'm here to fight for the re-education of what celebrity is. To say, \"Yes, we are celebrities, but yes, we're also innovators, we're also inventors, we're also thoughtful.\" of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: But that's sad to me. You should be able to be a human with feelings, too of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: That's fine. But that's not the case, is it? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Is that the way you feel, that you're always in the ring? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Yeah. I'm sitting right here, it's a fight. I'm fighting with the way I line my words up together and the way I place a sweater on top of a T-shirt. At this point, people know what's up. People know I'm smart. And people know that, whether it's SNL or Jimmy Kimmel, it's a trend to take the piss out of celebrity—just as much of a trend as wearing a gray hoodie or driving a Prius of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: But you voluntarily married into a celebrity family, right? In 2014, there are no bigger tabloid stars than Kim Kardashian of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: In the speech, I talked about the idea of collaboration and all the people involved working together and being able to change things. Meaning there was a time for two or three years where fashion designers wouldn't give Kim dresses. There was a time they wouldn't even let me be at shows. Now the idea that Kim is in a Givenchy Couture dress is raising the communication. Because people would be more apt to be like, \"Celebrities don't really have style. Celebrities can't dress. Celebrities are less educated.\" But they haven't had the chance to be able to break through and have Carine Roitfeld sitting right there. Carine Roitfeld is the Walt Disney of what Tumblr is today. She is the Kanye West of what Tumblr is today. She's the single most important person to what street style is today. And she was at the wedding seven seats down from Kim, who is one of the number one fashion plates of today. So I said, \"Wow, Carine is seven seats down from Kim. Farnaz [Farjam], the producer of the Kardashians and the producer of The Real World, is four seats down from [director] Steve McQueen. And four seats, because in between them is Hosain [Rahman] from Jawbone.\" This is what I talked about. That was not a forty-five-minute speech to myself. Do you realize what that means for those people to be in that close of a proximity to each other? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: But if you read a lot of the tabloid coverage, the implication is: Kim and her family are bringing you down. Jay Z and Beyoncé didn't show up at your wedding because of them. That kind of thing of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: All that, I wouldn't even speak on. It doesn't even matter to me whatsoever, who would show up. Because the most important person to show up there, to me, was Kim. And that's all that matters to me. I had to fight for that for seven years. But the fact that these other people showed up that are from such different worlds but have done such dynamic things—they're all, in a way, equal to what Kim has done in TV or what I had done in music. I was so moved that I just wanted people to stop and think they weren't sitting at a table full of fashion people, they weren't sitting at a table full of celebrities, they weren't sitting at a table full of movie directors. It really was a representation of the way we receive information today, post-Internet. And so Page Six can't overshadow the main point: Carine Roitfeld was sitting next to Kim Kardashian. That alone to me is like the same moment when I brought Mos Def to the studio with Jay Z. It's about the people, and the fact that they're from different walks of life, and that they're working together and not discriminating against each other. There was a class system, and now there's a creative class system, and I think that's what you were talking about a bit—the class system of creativity of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: And my point was, they leave Kim out of it of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: And my point is, they were all at her wedding of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: A skeptic would say that's because of you of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: But when an Instagram photo gets 2.3 million likes— of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Your wedding photo, which is currently the most liked photo on Instagram ever. of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: That's because of who? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: I don't know of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Don't say you don't know! It's because of Kim. Meaning there's no photo that I would have put up by myself, or next to one of my smarty friends, that would have got that amount of likes. So now you take this photo that has that amount of likes, and it has a flower wall from the same guy who does the Lanvin shows, and it has a couture Givenchy dress and Givenchy tuxedo in it. That's the point. Now the thing that is the most popular is also communicating the highest level of creativity. The concept of Kimye has more cultural significance than what Page Six could write of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Why'd you decide to get married? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Saying \"Hey, I like Kim\" isn't as inspiring to people as us getting married. And anyone that's in a relationship knows that in order to get to the point to get married and then to be married and to then carry on, it needs that work put into it. Right now, people look at it and it's like, \"Wow, that's inspiring.\" Meaning that love is infectious. You know, God is infectious—God flowing through us and us being little-baby creators and shit. But His energy and His love and what He wants us to have as people and the way He wants us to love each other, that is infectious. Like they said in Step Brothers: Never lose your dinosaur. This is the ultimate example of a person never losing his dinosaur. Meaning that even as I grew in cultural awareness and respect and was put higher in the class system in some way for being this musician, I never lost my dinosaur of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Kim is this girl who fucking turns me on. I love her. This is who I want to be next to and be around. And then people would try to say, \"Well, you know, if you're a musician, you should be with a musician, and if you want to design, you need to be with a girl from the design world.\" I don't give a fuck about people's opinions. Because when a kid falls in love with an airplane or a bike or a dinosaur—especially if you're an only child and it's not because of the book that the sibling was reading—it's like, fuck, you mean to tell me that the dinosaurs walked the earth and stuff like that?! That's amazing! You mean to tell me that these giant multi-ton crafts can fly that fast and that loud, and they can flip, and there's danger, the possibility of them exploding? That's fucking cool! You mean to tell me that this girl with this fucking body and this face is also into style, and she's a nice person, and she has her own money and is family-oriented? That's just as cool as a fucking fighter jet or dinosaur! And just as rarely seen of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: That's a lovely way of putting it of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: I feel like you're stronger as a team. Because when you know you have a team player, it's not one on the world anymore. At least it's two on the world of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Two and a half, if you want to count your daughter of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Yeah, and then two and a half, eventually. It's like having some eyes in the back of your head. That's one reason why, when people try to spoof or talk shit, it's like: But you're mad because basically Kim is the type of girl that, her entire life, if you were in school with her, most people would be studying and up late nights, but for some reason she would have the skill set to go and grab the one book, turn to the exact page, and just magically say, \"That's the exact answer.\" Or she could wink at the person who had done all the work and get it done anyway. And the point of life is getting shit done and being happy of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Are you the father you hoped you'd be? There's that song on Watch the Throne, \"New Day,\" where you and Jay Z talk about your unborn children, and you basically say: \"I want my kid to be completely the polar opposite of me.\" of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: And the joke was that I was supposed to say on the song, \"Come on, Jay, you know we're both gonna have daughters.\" And I'm so mad, because you know when I pop that creative-genius shit? If I had had that, that could've been my one moment where I'm like: \"Okay, fuck all the conversation. Look at that. I called that one.\" of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: How do you feel about Yeezus now, a year later? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: I think Yeezus is the beginning of a completely new era of music. It was all new rules. It just broke every rule possible. None of the ideas were popular ideas. Even \"Bound 2,\" when the video came out, I think people's apprehension—I mean, it's the same as any other Kanye West video. You just have colorful bears running around. It was completely morphed and weird and psychedelic and really druggy. I would have just liked to have had more nudity in it. That's the only thing. I just want to do crazy, colorful shit like that that has more nudity of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: What about \"New Slaves\"? Do you think people would react differently to that song if it came out now? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: It's funny, because when the Clippers situation happened, people started bringing up that song again. Sometimes you do things in the same way that a designer might throw out a new cut or a rapper might throw out a new concept, and people might not be into it at that time. If \"New Slaves\" had come out right after the Clippers incident, it would have seemed more timely. So the thirty meetings that I was having where I was going through a lot of these \"Stay in your place\" type conversations—\"Stay in your box, this is what you do, you can't do anything else\"—that led me to the point of creating \"New Slaves\" and \"Blood on the Leaves\" and the entire Yeezus album, and to make the album basically like a protest in music, where it only has like four melodies on it—you know, other people weren't in that place. Obviously certain things are more digestible for mass consumption. But it was interesting. That song that I do feel is the best rap verse of all of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Time— of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Which song? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: \"New Slaves.\" The second verse. I argue that it's the best rap verse of all time. It's the Coming to America or Anchorman of a verse. You know, it's got the funny shit. It's got the antagonization. It's got patterns. It's got social and political consciousness. It's got struggle. It's got bravado. It's everything that a rap verse is supposed to be of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Were you mad when Rick Rubin came out and said that you did half the vocals on Yeezus in two hours before hopping on a plane? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Yeah! Because yeah, I rapped them. But I worked on them for like eight months! And the thing is, I had to finish the verses in order for the album to come out, and it's game time. I didn't freestyle those verses. That shit was worked and processed and Disneyfied and everything. By the way, those lines are super scary and serious, and everything that I'm saying on Yeezus is super politically direct, so I think that it's funny that you said that, because I think he needs to clarify that to people—that I didn't make it up in that time. I just said them in that time of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: When you said what you said last year about the fashion industry and your frustration with it, did your phone ring after that? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: It did move the needle. Only positive came from it. Maybe I'm not as good friends as I could have been with the Saint Laurent designer. And now I don't get the red-and-black versions of the white-and-black pants that are in stores, or whatever I would have got as a musician. But other than that, that communication was real. Alexander Wang made sure that I was able to go to a Balenciaga show, and I was never allowed to do that before because I was a celebrity. Listen to what I'm saying—me, as Kanye West: I guarantee you, I'm more than 50 percent responsible for every men's shoe that they sell. Me, the singular person. More than 50 percent responsible for every Balenciaga shoe they sell. And they would say, \"You can't come to the show, because you are a celebrity.\" But all honesty, no ego, I have a level of influence, and I have a level of respect for the designers. And we move product on that Barneys floor of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: There's an analogy to music, right? You provided the sales template there, too. You can't listen to rap now without hearing music that sounds like your old music, right? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: It sounds exactly like that of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: What does that mean in terms of putting the new record together? Do you want the pendulum to swing back and do something more pop, like Twisted Fantasy or Graduation? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: I think just my usual pattern is like that. It's like a pendulum. The pendulum gains momentum by swinging in the other direction. Even lyrically, I think about certain lines that I say on my new single, which is called \"All Day,\" that usually Jay would say, but Jay's not on there. So I say, All day, nigga, it's Ye, nigga. Shopping for the winter, it's just May, nigga. Ball so hard, man, this shit cray, nigga. You ain't getting money unless you got eight figures. Right? Jay would have said that. And then eventually I would have came in with, like, whatever I come in with. But the balance of a meal is that when people walk in, they want water first. People definitely weren't getting water first on Yeezus. I do fight with myself to say, \"Keep fighting.\" But also, you know, you can't win every single fight. It's a long war, and if you're out there trying to, like, blow up every single building, you won't win the war of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Yeezus seemed to be a moment when you maybe let go of wanting a Grammy. You let go of wanting record sales, in a way that seemed uncharacteristic for you of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: When I was sitting and trying to do a collaboration with the Gap, in the meeting, when they're like, \"No, because you're a celebrity, and you have a bad reputation, and you don't know anything about clothing, so we don't want to do this\"—in that meeting, there's no extra single that I could have done that could have got me that deal. There's no extra Grammy that I could have won that could have made it more real. And that's the reason why I had to express the way I feel. Which all rhymed just right there. But Yeezus was extremely purposeful. And what came from Yeezus: Paparazzi are nicer to me. The entire fashion industry is nicer to me. I do have a collaboration coming out. Young designers that would go and work at a house now look and say, \"Wow, maybe we could potentially work at Donda. Maybe we could work for Kanye. Maybe that's a real thing.\" Because designers that are geared up to only want to work at a French fashion house are completely under the perception that it wouldn't be cool to work for a celebrity of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: But it's such a delicate dance, right? At a certain point, maybe you have to go back and you have to sell some records, win some awards, to maintain your spot in music of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Man, it's crazy. And having to take all of your energy, or a lot more of your energy, to focus on fashion. And while you're focusing on that, such-and-such just keeps coming for the spot of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: And I might complain about how hard it is in clothing, but also I think it's great that it's so hard. Because the barrier to entry is really, really, really, really high. And I'm literally trying to do—back when I did Watch the Throne, and the fashion, I think it was just too much for people. It was just too crazy. It was just too crazy to do Watch the Throne, \"Niggas in Paris,\" shoot a surround-vision film in Qatar, show the film in Cannes… of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Put a kilt on of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Yeah, kilt. Then do two fashion shows with Jourdan Dunn, Joan Smalls, Irina Shayk, have Diddy, Anna Wintour, Riccardo, Kim at the show, and drop the Yeezys?

No. This is just too crazy.\" of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",

      "Line: But you fell back from that of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Both me and Kim had to learn how to communicate as a team. These are two LeBrons, you know? Meaning she could do shit that a girlfriend in a relationship could never do. Obviously. And I could do stuff that a guy in a relationship could never do. So if you look at half my tweets back then, they were always, like, funny tweets that I wouldn't be able to say now. It wouldn't be respectful to my relationship. It's interesting, as I'm delving into being married: Like, what is my verbal creative communication? That's another thing I really like about clothing and film—you could still communicate with a film, because it's not you. But when you're a reality star or a rapper, you are the film of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: That's been true for you, right? The year 2010 was really just a different kind of movie of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Yeah. It was more Wolf of Wall Street. of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: You've said that one of the reasons you did Watch the Throne was that you wanted to learn to communicate in the easy way that Jay Z communicated. Do you feel like that experience helped you at all? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Yes! It's picking up skill sets that give you longevity. That's what I like about Jay. He has longevity. He's still at the top of relevancy from the way he moves, the way he interacts with people, his ability to brush things off of his shoulder and just win at life. He's the poster child of winning. And I think I was the poster child of, like, fighting and winning. But you always saw the fight. And with Jay, you always saw the win of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Another gifted communicator in your life is Kim. Have you learned from her? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: That's funny that you're saying that. One of the reasons why I think that me and Kim are very powerful together isn't just the concept of celebrity or this mega rap star and this mega-beautiful pop star. It's something I explain to my girl: She is who she is. I am who I am. We have advisers and friends and everything, but those people are who they are and we are who we are. And what I had to learn from Kim is how to take more of her advice and less of other people's advice. There's a lot of Kim K skills that were added. In order to win at life, you need some Kim K skills, period of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: How close are you, fashion-line-wise? A year away? Five years away? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: It depends. I think the people that are in the positions of power are starting to see or recognize that it's more than a celebrity thing, it's more than a music thing, and that there is something there. There's people who do celebrity lines. It's what they do. They've signed up to sit at a different table and to be in a different business than the people who do high-end lines of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",

      "Line: I don't know, man. I hope I can get one of these songs out in the next couple of weeks, just to have something up and running. But I think most likely September. I go back and forth. Like, should it be September or should it be October? Should it be November? When Beyoncé was working on her last album, she took a while. I was thinking it could somehow come out in June, like Yeezus, and just kill it for the summer. But then I'm like, I have to work on Adidas and be with my child of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: But you have a lot of the first single already? of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Yeah. This time three years ago, here at the Mercer, working on \"Niggas in Paris,\" at this time in early June, it was apparent it was still not finished. I had the \"married at the mall\" line, we had \"that shit cray,\" Jay had his verse… Jay finished his verse. He always finishes, and my shit is always kind of open. Like, \"Okay, now I've got the Will Ferrell sample, so I need to say something that finishes the verse. But people have to not know what it means.\" [laughs] So it's like problem-solving to get to the point where you're saying, \"going gorillas.\" It's difficult sometimes of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: But now, for the new album, one new thing could change everything. I had an idea of the way I wanted to do the album. And then I got a new song that's so good that the album has to be balanced against it. This song is a song that can be in the club like \"Don't Like\" or \"Niggas in Paris.\" Whereas before I was working on the album and I had these beautiful songs, they were just more songs. They weren't saying, \"Okay, tuck your whole summer in.\" They were just saying, \"Hey, I'm a great musician, I make these beautiful songs, and they have all this meaning, and nobody can make anything that means this much.\" of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",

      "Line: Well, when I work on an album, it's fun at certain times. There's some accomplishments, and sometimes there's a bit of frustration. And it's usually like a nine-month process, right? This is a multi-lifetime process that we have now embarked on. Meaning starting now, you're just starting to see a glimmer of what the idea of West will mean. So right now, at this age and with this visibility and with the skill sets that Kim is now giving me, I think I have a good chance of success in building something that has longevity, high integrity, high success rate, and is very fulfilling, not only for me creatively but also in adding fulfillment to people's lives. Adding ease. Adding wonder. Adding magic of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: But does happiness arrive at the end of that rainbow? I think people genuinely wonder that of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Well, you build your happy wife, happy life, happy home, all this stuff, right? Everybody that's in a relationship that has ever worked on a home knows one of the most frustrating processes is actually working on the home. So when people would see me last year, two years ago, unhappy, I was in the process of building the home of TMZ Freestyle by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: But what makes me happy is land, and we're on a boat now. This is Christopher Columbus. This is uncharted waters we're on. We'd be super happy to be on land, and also a little bit like, \"Ah, the journey's over!\" But I feel like, we got the Vogue cover, Steve McQueen won the Oscar, we finally got married… You know? We have a child. We're a family now. I am an arbiter of taste, and people think that I have the ability to make things cool—or if I'm doing it, it should be cool. And I feel that this stuff's starting to be cool. And that feels good to me. Because I don't like walking around with people thinking I'm doing uncool shit, because there's nothing I'm doing that's uncool. It's all innovative. You just might not understand it yet. But it's cool. Family is super cool. Going home to one girl every night is super cool. Just going home and getting on the floor and playing with your child is super cool. Not wearing a red leather jacket, and just looking like a dad and shit, is like super cool. Having someone that I can call Mom again.

      "Line: 2 ContributorsTrimalchio from Chicago: Flashing Lights and the Great Kanye in West Egg (excerpt) LyricsThere is an axiom that says all books are about other books. This proposition is supported by the fact that the archetypes found in the earliest of recorded literature continue to (re)appear in contemporary literature. Following the supposition that music lyrics, when read through a literary lens, also fall into the contemporary literature categories it is safe to posit that many of the archetypes of classical literature appear in contemporary music. Further, it can be assumed that there exist many songs, as there exist many poems (and other artworks in other forms), \"about\" classical literature, intentionally or otherwise, that can be used as a tool to make the canonized works more accessible to many students if we open our eyes to the existent possibilities. The popularity (and co-optation in many instances) of hip-hop culture in pop culture places rap music lyrics at the forefront of youthful preoccupation. The storied career of Kanye West places him in great company with moguls such as Jay-Z and Sean Combs not only as a hip-hop tastemaker, but also as a cultural icon with the ability to affect other areas of art and \"everyday\" living. West has been responsible, almost single-handedly, the cultural movements (progressions, even) in hip-hop and popular culture over the span of his career. Arguably one of the more controversial popular culture icons, Kanye West's life and career can provide interesting background and analysis for comparison (and contrasting) to one of literature's most famous characters, Jay Gatsby of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: As Gatsby's quest for Daisy represents the American Dream, so can Kanye West's quest (personal and professional) be similarly viewed. West's fascinating life story, highlighted by his debut album, College Dropout, is phenomenal, and set his trajectory to the highest of heights, ultimately garnering 10 Grammy nominations, and winning the Best Rap Album Grammy for \"Jesus Walks.\" Jay Gatsby usually fascinates students even if they don't particularly enjoy or understand F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel. The Great Gatsby is probably one of my favorite works to teach because of the time period--the flourishing of the Arts, The Jazz Age, and The Harlem Renaissance---The Roaring Twenties. The Great Depression plays a part in my love of the era as well, but only to symbolize that all good things come to an end, so to speak, as did the run of Jay Gatsby (and those of his ilk). The version of The Great Gatsby taught at my high school, \"The Authorized Text,\" has a preface written by Matthew J. Bruccoli (1992) that states, regarding The Great Gatsby being \"the great American novel\":If this phrase means anything, it means that the novel is the great work of fiction with defining American thematic qualities and that James Gatz/Jay Gatsby is the great American character. He believes in the American Dream of success (\"the orgastic future\"); he fulfills it; he confuses it with Dais),; he is betrayed by it. The appellation great as applied to Gatsby reverberates with irony. He is truly great by virtue of his capacity to commit himself to his aspirations. (xi)I agree that Jay Gatsby has come to symbolize \"the great American character\" much more than I believe The Great Gatsby to be \"the great American novel,\" but my arrival at this opinion of Gatsby has come slowly; unfolding as a great narrative itself, told by a narrator with a bit of distance from its central subject, yet close enough to be privy to details so intimate as to captivate a reader. Bruccoli (1992) refers to Nick Carraway as \"the partially involved narrator\" (xii). I would say such a storyteller narrates this tale of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Much as some people fall in love with the grand concepts of idealism and romanticism, fueling their love for literature, I am simply in love with the hip-hop love story, which fuels nay love for music. It's become an archetype of its own: A kid, somewhere in the world, hears something said in between a kick and a snare drum that evokes a visceral feeling and, at that moment, is struck by H.E.R.--Hip Hop in its Essence and Real, as described by Common Sense in '94 Common (1994). Every person who professes a love for hip-hop knows the moment, and can recall, in vivid detail, their first meeting, courtship, love affair, and heartbreak[s] due to the relationship. I compare the love for literature and. music because one of nay primary methods of teaching literature has been not only through nay love for music, particularly rap lyrics, but also through ideas, expressions, themes, concepts, and characters in hip-hop culture. In Book of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip Hop, Adam Bradley (2009) makes the case for rap's of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Literary merits:Between the street life and the good life is a broad expanse of\" human experience. Rap has its screenwriters, making Hollywood blockbusters in rhyme with sharp cuts, vivid characters, and intricate plotlines. It has its investigative reporters and conspiracy theorists, its biographers and memoirists, its True Crime authors and its mystery writers. It even has its comics and its sportswriters, its children's authors and its spiritualists. It is high concept and low brow; it has literary hacks and bona fide masters. It has all of these and more, extending an oral tradition as fundamental to human experience, as ancient and as essential, as most anything we have. (158)Even before I had words to clarify this notion of rap as literature, much of my academic education had been informed by it. I would read a piece of literature and automatically make a connection to it somewhere in the realm of hip-hop culture. Bradley (2009) goes a step further to clarify, \"To tell a Familiar narrative in a new way is the motivating impulse behind a lot of rap storytelling\" (159). As a reader of literature, I always found myself discovering the \"familiar narrative\" while listening to the \"new way\" it's being told through hip-hop. With The Great Gatsby being taught in high schools across the world, and the renewed interest in F. Scott Fitzgerald and his novel because of Baz Luhrmann's 2013 movie adaptation (arguably a Hollywood blockbuster), I've come to see, more and more, Jay Gatsby's life as a possible parallel to Kanye West's of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: I will venture to say that my students' interest in Kanye West is much like their interest in Jay Gatsby--even if they don't particularly enjoy or understand his musical or lyrical intentions, they are interested in him as a person, as a character in the world of pop culture. I will also state that Kanye West, as an artist has, at some point or another in his storied career, worn all of the writerly hats Adam Bradley describes. He has been the screenwriter (his 2010 song, \"Runaway,\" became a short film collaboration with Hype Williams), the investigative reporter and conspiracy theorist (the 2005 song \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone,\" among others), the biographer and memoirist (the 2007 song \"Big Brother,\" a tribute to Jay-Z and his debut single, \"Through the Wire,\" respectively), True Crime author and mystery author (the 2011 collaboration with Jay-Z, \"Murder to Excellence\" and the 2007 song, \"Homecoming,\" respectively), comic (much of his lyrical content depends on witty, comedic elements) and sportswriter (the 2007 collaboration with Li'l Wayne, \"Barry Bonds\"), and his lyrical and musical content ranges from low brow to high brow, all of which can be argued to be very intentional on the part of the artist of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: By way of analogy, this is where I begin my The Great Gatsby lessons with my high school students--with Kanye West. Not only Kanye, but also the world in which he operates that has heralded and hated him, admired and despised him, created and destroyed him. Of course, I would not just give the students Kanye and hip-hop/pop culture as a backdrop and set them loose. There's historical precedent for this comparison that the students should know about. Along with abundant information on the \"Jazz Age,\" I present Langston Hughes's 1926 essay, \"The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain.\" Hughes writes of the plight of\"Negro artists\" creating in America in the 1920s--the Harlem Renaissance and some artists' aspirations to create art that is, somehow, not representative of their race or culture, for instance, a poet--not a Negro poet\" (1). This essay begins a discussion about the \"responsibility\" of artists regarding their lives and their art. I ask, \"Can an artist simply be an artist without any consciousness of race and/or culture?\" and \"If so, are his message and meaning likely to be misinterpreted or misjudged because of the titles we, as students, teachers, appreciators, consumers and critics, place on the artist, whether it's African-American, female, young, old?\" This always leads to an interesting discussion, especially because of the correlation to the same questions being asked about current trends and artists in pop culture. Hughes (1926) sums up his perspective in the closing of his essay:We younger Negro artists who create now intend to express our individual dark-skinned selves without fear or shame. If white people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, it doesn't matter. We know we are beautiful. And ugly too. The tom-tom cries and the tom-tom laughs. If colored people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, their displeasure doesn't matter either. We build our temples for tomorrow, strong as we know how, and we stand on top of the mountain, free within ourselves. (1)Of course, this is only one of many perspectives on the obligation of artists, specifically \"Negro\" artists, but raises the question of \"keeping it real,\" so to speak, and also makes for a perfect connection to the conversation about hip-hop culture, pop culture, and the responsibility of popular artists to be \"good\" representatives of what it means to be black in America. It opens up conversations about mainstream v. underground, the business of music (or art, in general) and artistic integrity of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: After a bit of conversation about the era in which the work was created, I like to discuss the author of the work, to see if the students can gain any valuable information about the work from the life of the person who created it. In his Gatsby introduction, Bruccoli (1992) recalls an F. Scott Fitzgerald quote from 1922, before The Great Gatsby was written, in which he declares, \"I want to write something new--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple + intricately patterned\" (vii). Similarly Kanye West, in an interview with the New York Times's Jon Caramanica (2013), preceding the release of his album Yeezus, heralds it as a project on which Kanye strives for \"aspirational minimalism,\" stating, \"I want to break glass ceilings\" (n.p.). Mr. West's previous solo album is interestingly, in this context, titled My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010). No author, no artist, is so independent of his work that his craft, his brushstrokes, his personality', some degree of his being is not recognizable in the stories he tells. As Fitzgerald wrote Gatsby Kanye writes KANYE. It is a well-known fact that much of what Fitzgerald wrote was inspired by people he'd known (or knew, as is the case with his wife Zelda, and the pages of her diary that inspired some of his stories). As much as they write about the worlds in which they live, both write about themselves. My comparison of Kanye West as a personality--a character--presented in his music and to the music and pop culture-consuming public to Jay Gatsby, therefore, also operates as a comparison of Kanye West as an author and architect to F. Scott Fitzgerald as well. Both men, to varying degrees of achievement, create great American success stories, just as Kanye West's life follows the archetype embodied by Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: With the groundwork laid, the discussion of the archetypes can commence. It's at this point that I digress a bit, but only to help illustrate my greater point. I start, as one should, at the beginning of the novel of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",

      "Line: I met Kanye West in 1999. We both performed at a music festival at Columbia College in Chicago, and I had just killed what was one of the biggest shows of my short \"professional\" rap career. The year leading up to that show 17 had struggled.

      "Line: I even quoted a few lines fi'om \"What You Do to Me\" to prove I actually was a fan. I gave him a copy of my demo, and we exchanged information. There was a fbllow-up call the next day--he liked two tracks (there were 17 on the tape), and even offered production for an exceptionally reasonable price. I thanked him for the feedback and the offer of a businesslike relationship. I passed on the beats. I prided myself on the fact that I had relationships with producers who worked pro bono, because they liked the rhymes I wrote to their music, and I was the epitome of a struggling artist, so I didn't have the money, even if I wanted to purchase tracks. But I was on my way to stardom and figured our paths would cross again somewhere beyond the atmosphere. My assuredness was only secured by the fact that I had met him--one of my heroesÿon an even playing field. We were doing the same thing. We performed on the same stage of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: The next year I would release my album, do more shows, and eventually lose all of that optimistic ambition about nwmyrap career. In that same year Kanye West would go on to become KANYE WEST, tapper/producer extraordinaire, hip-hop/pop culture icon. When his debut album, The College Dropout, dropped in 2004, I was fresh out of school, having finished my Bachelor's degree in English Education and Creative Writing. I was right back where I started, I thought, in those classrooms that helped shape my rap dreams, the same city that fueled those hip-hop ambitions. I became an English teacher because rap didn't work out. I don't think it was because I'm not skilled at it; I just don't think I could commit fully to the idea of venturing outso f:ar with no guarantees and no backup plan of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: I would continue to write and rap, releasing several music projects, a multimedia novel, and a collection of poetry, stories, and essays. I would eventually come to understand that Mr. West and I were (and possibly still are) flipsides to the same coin. Hip-hop never stopped being my outlet, and I would argue having the experiences that led to my reentry to academia and my career as an educator made me more studious, more industrious, and more driven to \"make it.\" I felt his debut album lampooned what I was doing, and felt it was not only a slight on me and people like me, but also a dangerous message to anyone who listened and thought it might be just that easy to become a celebrity overnight of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: I've made it my duty to follow West's career, if for no other reason than to remain aware of how he attempts to move hip-hop culture forward, to see what possibly could have been. I am aware of the fact that his career and mine are different roads traveled from that fateful (for are) meeting in 1999. I am also aware of the fact that it has made all the difference in the world that the road he is traveling has informed mine, and in maw ways, mine his. I set out to prove, despite his lampooning, a man could graduate from college, love hip- of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Hop, produce, create, excel, and be fulfilled. I imagine that he has spent his career answering to fans like me, the ones who know about the Infamous Syndicate work and the Bad Boy work--the people who were (and still are) fans, and want to know what's next of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Not only do I continue writing verses and songs, I have found a bit of contentment in writing about hip-hop. In that way, I like to fancy myself Nick Carraway. Carraway moves from the Midwest to New York to learn the bond business; I wanted to learn the business of hip-hop. Nick meets Jay Gatsby, the epitome of the American Dream successful, flashy, host of the best parties. In my imagination, Jay Gatsby is Kanye West. West has not been able to find peace in the limelight, rather, it seems the more attention he receives, the more he balks at the very idea of \"fame.\" It could be argued that Kanye West, much like F. Scott Fitzgerald's titular character, is somehow standing in a vast wilderness--perhaps pop culture--the darkness that is the current state of hip-hop (music and culture)--looking out over the ocean at the ever-elusive flashing lights. It's my job to narrate the story and try my best not to judge, simply state facts as I know them to be of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Interestingly enough, the Kanye comparison works in this archetypical fashion, and brings many parallels with it. Reality television has given Kim Kardashian a platform to flaunt the excesses of celebrity for the sake of celebrity. She is one of the highest earning reality television stars, and is involved in many business ventures as a result of her reality television fame--quite an ascension from being the daughter of O. J. Simpson's defense attorney and step-daughter of an American Olympic gold medalist. If Kanye is Gatsby, then one could easily make a very basic case for Kim Kardashian being Daisy Buchanan, the self-absorbed party girl/flapper from \"old money\" with whom Gatsby becomes enamored and who sets him on course to create a fantasy in which she can live and he can have her to himself, forever reliving those wonderful moments they shared in their youth; her (ex) husband, Kris Humphries, would perhaps be Tom Buchanan, Daisy's husband, who represents \"old money\" as well, and is a former athlete. Tom could very easily be paralleled to Reggie Bush as well, and perhaps more appropriately so since Kanye's former friend and collaborator, Consequence (2013), revealed (with Jen \"The Pen\" Bayer, the mother of his child), in a January 21, 2013, interview on New York's Power 105.1 Breakfast Club Show, that he'd facilitated meetings between Kim and Kanye while she was dating the NFL star. Consequence, then, would understand Nick Carraway's discomfort when asked to do the very same for Gatsby and Daisy in chapter 4 of the novel, which he eventually does in chapter 5. This is a pivotal moment for Gatsby, because it seems it is the realization of his dream, to have Daisy. His life's work is complete because he has obtained what it is that he has worked so hard to get; whether it's genuinely the love of his life, or if she is a symbol of status, Gatsby has Daisy, and the charade, it seems, is over. He has proven himself, perhaps only to himself. Gatsby calls off his lavish parties, preoccupied with his new \"life\" with Daisy, and Nick, during a visit to the Buchanan home where Gatsby and Jordan Baker are also present, becomes acutely aware of Daisy's disinterest in her and Tom's young child. This is the point at which the reader comes to learn the defining aspects and true nature of all the principal characters in the novel. This is also the beginning of Gatsby's great fall. At this point, the comparison of Gatsby to Kanye becomes more the work of the student than anything, leaving room for contrast and speculation regarding Mr. West's ultimate fate or whether his life can be seen as wholly comparable to that of Gatsby. Nick ultimately becomes aware that the Buchanans are careless people who recklessly go through life doing whatever they please, only to retreat behind their money when anything goes awry. Whatever your opinion of the world and the people who occupy the world in which Kanye West lives, there exists a viable correlation, and if not, at least room for a meaningful discussion on the topic of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: As previously stated, I find great interest in the hip-hop love story-- Hip Hop in its Essence and Real--and how this love sets many artists on the same course as Gatsby after he met Daisy, in 1917. And, like Gatsby with Daisy, the artist finds H.E.R. \"excitingly desirable,\" perhaps because the meeting is \"a colossal accident,\" but he still takes \"what he can get, ravenously and unscrupulously,\" and ultimately, after having her finds that he has \"committed himself to the following of a grail,\" feeling \"married to her\" (155-157). The artist finds that he is in love with H.E.R. and will do most anything to havc H.E.R. the way that he had H.E.R. when they first met. Common is disillusioned and despises that he sees H.E.R. comn:ercialized, used, and abused, and vows to \"take her back\" much as Gatsby aims to take Daisy back from Tom. Whereas in Gatsby's case, \"It excited him too that many men had already loved Daisy--it increased her value in his eyes,\" Common feels a bit different (156). Common is obviously displeased with H.E.R. dalliances with other artists because he wants H.E.R. all to himsel£ of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Kanye West, on his 2008 album Graduation, pays homage to Common's \"I Used to Love H.E.R.\" with \"Homecoming,\" an ode to a \"girl\" he met when he was three years old named \"Wendy.\" His lyrics formulate a well-hidden conceit much like Common's, only to reveal that instead of being a story about \"Hip Hop,\" this is homage to \"Chi-Town.\" Hip hop, by connecting the past to the present of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Creates for future artists a story that merits repeating, remixing, and retelling. If the axiom is true, and all books are indeed about other books, perhaps all songs are about other songs, or, more fittingly, all lyrics are about other lyrics. And maybe, then, the journey of Kanye's to reclaim a \"lost love\" has much less to do with Kim Kardashian as an emblematic status symbol or a reminder of the promise of times past like Daisy,a and snore to do with Hip Hop in its Essence and Real. And perhaps that \"aspirational sparseness\" that he is now testing out is his telling us, as the passage in The Great Gatsby in which Gatsby says to Nick, who cautions him not to get his hopes up about Daisy because their past can't be repeated, \"'Can't repeat the past?' he cried incredulously. 'Why of course you can!'\" (116). Kanye constantly speaks about his duty as an artist to aspire to purity. This, it seems, is the true essence of art for him, and is perhaps what drives him to not only be a fascinating cultural figure, but also solidifies his comparison to Jay Gatsby--the reaching out toward the metaphorical green light at the end of the Buchanan's dock, the willingness to risk all of his successes and accomplishments to push forward and to push back, the need to say and do what he feels needs to be said and done to maintain that purity, the essence of what he sees as H.E.R. In a Rolling Stone (2010) interview about My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy he states:I forget the word, but there's [sic] people throughout history that [sic] their responsibility is to be conveyors of truth on to next generations. There's a word far that type of person. And I feel like I'm that type of person that [sic] has to carry on the truth and tell 'The Story' not 'His Story.' Tell the story; where it's like Raphael's painting Jesus' wish, knowing the pope would have his head but he died before the pope got the piece. But as a [sic] artist he said, \"Yo, I need to express this our I'll die, I'll die inside. This is what I saw, this is what I want to paint as a [sic] artist.\" I feel like artists take their lives to serious or not serious enough. Where, you know, who would really put their life on the line for what they really, really believe in? Who would make a sacrifice?Kanye goes on in the interview to explain that he believes many of his contemporaries to be \"scared,\" saying they \"run away from popular culture,\" and because of this, he sees them as \"falling short of the greatness of Rock 'n' Roll\" (Video Interview1°). From his humble, anonymous beginnings in the world of hip-hop, produchlg music he was barely credited for doing, to his production work on one of the defining albums in hip-hop history, Jay-Z's Blueprint, Kanye West has aspired to see hip-hop created and performed in its purest essence. In an interview about his debut album, The College Dropout, with Associated Press writer Nekesa Mumbi Moody (2004), West states that his hip-hop aspirations started early, first convincing his mother to loan him money to buy his first keyboard, believing so much in himself and his musical potential that he says, \"I thought I was going get sig toned back when I was 13 years old, and come out with a record and take Kris Kross out\" (1) of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: That moment created by Kanyc West in 2004, when he experienced H.E.R., the essence of hip-hop, and brought the world his view of what hip-hop could be--The College Dropout-- created a moment he's been striving to recreate since, as Gatsby did all he could, throwing his lavish weekly parties and befriending her cousin Nick, to create the circumstance in which he could again have a chance encounter with Daisy. Feeling \"married\" in those moments to their respective dreams, both set on a course fprward, by going backward, propelled toward an ideal future by a \"perfect moment\" from their pasts. Nick narrates to readers at the close of the novel, \"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us\" (189). To Gatsby; the green light is a sym- bol of Daisy, of old money, perhaps of wealth in general, of simpler times, of happiness--all ideas associated with the American Dream. As Kanye West has written and recorded songs such as \"All of the Lights,\" \"Flashing Lights,\" and \"Street Lights,\" on topics that could easily be aligned with the ideals of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness--\"The Good Life,\" to use his own words, but also being sure to shine as much light on the \"bad\" as the \"good,\" embracing Langston Hughes's challenge, \"express[ing] [his] individual dark- skinned [self] without fear or shame,\" baring his soul for the sake of art--the dream of any artist (1). Gatsby's fate is sealed, as he is consumed by the world he creates and in which he participates. It's not the implied illegal activities in which he is rumored to be involved, but the fantasy he creates, of picking up from that moment they met and continuing his life with Daisy. Reporter Chris Campion (2011) asks Kanye if he feels as though the success of his debut album is because he \"brought something different back to hip hop\" (1). Kanye replies, \"Well, I don't know how you can bring something different back. You can either bring something that's done back or else bring something different\" (1). The brand of different created by Kanye with H.E.R. has been his aspiration since The College Dropout, to what levels of success he has achieved it is debatable. He has not met Gatsby's fate, though some fans and critics believe the \"old\" Kanye to be no more. To date, Kanye's is a happier tale than Gatsby's: he's both got his dream girl in Kim Kardashian and he's doing his dream job, receiving much critical acclaim for his latest musical contribution, Yeezus. He goes on to tell Campion, \"I guess [I'm] bringing something different. Hip hop is fixated on fantasy\" (1). Unlike Gatsby, Kanye's fantasy has worked out, and he has found a way to successfully live in it of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: As for nay part as the \"partially involved narrator,\" I, as Nick, am \"inclined to reserve all judgments\" (5). Maybe, in the end, we will all come to see Kanye in the same light Nick saw Gatsby:...who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life:, as if he were related to one of those machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the \"creative temperament\"--it was his extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.Kanye may very well be hip-hop's Gatsby, representing everything I loathe about the culture while simultaneously embodying ever thing that is beautiful about it as well, because the recognition of those loathsome attributes are simply a reflection--a yin to a yang--of what is beautiful. Perhaps Kanye's life, as Gatsby's could likewise easily be described, is evolving into a beautiful, dark, twisted fantasy into which his sensitivity provides an outlook we consumers, mere outsiders peeking in at (or, through), only register through the binary of \"genius\" or \"crazy\" \"Creative temperament\" is what we tend to call it, because we have--even if he hasn't, and has no reason to--given up hope, and rather than recognize it as the extraordinary gift it is, we mistakenly overlook it in search of something else. We look for another angle: a controversy, a quarrel, a personality flaw, or something even less significant, when we could simply try to view Kanye as Nick saw Gatsby of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",
      "Line: Eventually, we may come to say \"No--Kanye turned out all right in the end; it was what preyed on Kanye, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out our interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.\" (7) And we will realize that he was \"worth the whole damn bunch put together,\" Nick's words to Gatsby at the end of their last meeting, letting Gatsby know that Nick sees him for who he is: A great man who believes in his dream and is willing to sacrifice everything in his quest to reach itYou might also likeEmbed of Us Placers by Kanye West\n",
